Hi everyone, I’m OnnMacMahal, and I want to talk to you about the upcoming changes to the Minstrel class. We’ve converted the minstrel’s ‘Protector of Song’ specialization tree into a passive tree, functioning the same way as the brawler’s yellow tree does. I’m here to answer a few questions up front, and give you a bit of insight into our thinking regarding these changes.,
,
,
,
With U33.2, minstrels will no longer be able to choose the ‘Protector of Song’ trait tree as their specialization. You’ll still be able to specialize in the other two trait trees, and the yellow tree isn’t going anywhere! While you won’t be able to choose yellow as your specialization, it is still full of exciting stuff. For most players, this means you’ll be able to access unique skills like Song of Aid and Call to Greatness while specializing in either ‘The Watcher of Resolve’ or ‘The Warrior-Skald’ trait lines.,
,
,
,
,
The yellow minstrel line has a strong identity, but while there are good reasons to specialize in the ‘Protector of Song’ those reasons aren’t usually better than the reasons for specializing in blue or red. Yet it still has some very clear utility, and we regularly see minstrels swapping to a full yellow line spec to fire off all the buffs they can before swapping back to blue (or red) as a fight starts. And while it doesn’t have quite enough power or utility to justify using as a main spec, we see a lot of you considering the yellow line and keeping a yellow setup around. We just don’t see many folks , in yellow line for very long. Obviously there are exceptions, but at the moment, minstrels staying in yellow spec for group content tend to be for niche circumstances.,
Our goal is not to remove yellow line or yellow line’s identity, but to fold yellow line back into being a core part of the minstrel, accessible regardless of whether you’re in red line doing landscape quests, blue line main-healing a raid, or any other activity.,
,
,
,
,
A , of things are changing. For the full list of changes, please see the release notes or hop into Bullroarer and check things out for yourself! However, I’ll cover a few broad categories of changes below:,
,
,
,
,
Anthems are an iconic part of the minstrel’s toolkit, but they aren’t always a very exciting part of the class. We want anthems to be more interesting to use, but we don’t want them to simply be a chore to maintain. To that end, anthems all now share a cooldown, have shortened durations, and can only be used in combat. We’ve also added a couple anthems and made sure they’re distributed around the trait trees. This means it won’t be possible for a single minstrel to maintain 100% uptime on all their anthems for the group. You’ll have to be a bit choosier with your anthems, but you also won’t be waiting for your anthem buffs to expire, only to pause what you’re doing and click through all of your anthems one by one to refresh the buffs.,
Anthem buffs should also now have greater parity with one another. You should always want to have more anthem buffs, without feeling like any particular anthem is an absolute must-have above everything else.,
,
Anthems also used to apply bonus effects to your next Coda, but these effects could be a bit confusing, and it could be hard to tell which ones were ‘queued up’ for your next Coda. These effects will now trigger directly off of their relevant Anthems, provided you have a point in the new ‘Invigorating Anthems’ trait.,
,
,
,
These two are a pair of awesome skills, but their effects varied widely in usefulness and could be difficult or impossible to utilize meaningfully. They’ve been changed so that they now have more unified effects for all of your allies:,
Song of Aid is now a strong defensive cooldown, granting a brief Heal over Time and a Damage reduction & reflect, so help you get back on your feet when things start to go sideways.,
Call to Greatness now resets a key or capstone cooldown for every trait tree for every class. This means that regardless of your chosen class or role, you should have a skill which will have its cooldown reset by Call to Greatness. This will allow Call to Greatness to be used both offensively and defensively, and make its effects relevant for everyone.,
That said, not all classes are equal, and some have more impactful long-cooldown skills than others. So while some classes or specializations will still benefit from the new Call to Greatness effect more than others, there should be better parity overall, and we’re certainly willing to look at outliers going forward.,
,
,
,
While Dissonance and Resonance have clear benefits, Melody has never had a very strong identity. While making changes to the yellow line, we wanted to strengthen the identity of the Melody stance a bit. While it can do , healing and , damage, it doesn’t excel at either, so we made some changes to make Melody better at applying debuffs, buffs, and unique effects.,
Debuffs applied by Echoes of Battle and Call of Orome are now stronger while in Melody. Similarly, Piercing Cry only removes corruptions and stuns on critical hits when used in Melody. Additionally, Call to Fate can be used in Melody, though it will do less damage than it will in Dissonance.,
,
Minstrels have three core skills which change depending on stance: your strike, your piercing cry, and your coda. Strike skills have been rebalanced slightly against one another, so their healing and damage values change more depending on your stance. Likewise, Piercing Cry now has more utility in Melody, does more damage in Dissonance, and is weaker offensively in Resonance. Codas (when traited) also now have bonus effects related to their respective stances.,
,
,
,
We know this is a lot of changes all at once, but we hope it improves overall gameplay for Minstrels, lets you access some of the unique abilities formerly hidden behind the yellow specialization, and helps you all feel like protectors of song.,
,
Keep in mind that this is Bullroarer, so some of these changes may not be final, but we want to know what you think, and we look forward to seeing your reactions and feedback below.

					You're deleting the classic support bard archetype and removing the closest thing the game had to an rCaptain competitor (outside of maybe bLM with the new crowthies). Yellow was definitely problematic as is but really feel like you should've gone the route of making it a competitive (non-stacking) replacement for red Captains in group content rather than leaving us with the same red Captain support dominance that's existed for over a decade.

					I think this is a great thought! This really helped define Brawlers... it was also part of my initial problem with the Class Tree's move, back when... it removed options! This seems to go a long way at adding those options back into the main objectives of the class. ,
,
I would love to see changes like this for other classes as well.

					Why can't anthems be made available outside of combat? Since they have a common cd. At least 1 of them to squeeze before the start of the battle is already good

					First off all: if you really want to capture the feedback of the community for such massive class changes it would be great to translate the BR patchnotes for minstrels to German and French to give those players in the community who might not be so fluent in English the chance to participate in the discussion or at least give their Feedback.

					While I can understand why some people wouldn't like this, it would be a feeling more based on ""nostalgia"" and ideals than based on how the class has functioned for many years and the actual viability of the spec, so I think it's a valid decision. Over the years, I feel the least played specs of some other classes (or those easier to turn into supporting trees) might undergo a similar revamp, although others will probably remain unchanged, or saved for last.

,They should have said something like, ""We want Anthems to feel like you're making meaningful choices in a dynamic environment rather than mindlessly pressing 4 buttons every 2.5 minutes. To that end, you'll now get to experience making an anthem choice every 25 seconds (slightly more often with trait points in Invigorating Anthems)."" The chore would be having anthems that you spend all your time applying/reapplying, so you couldn't heal or damage while maintaining them.,
,
Only trick is, that you're only going to be able to play 2–4 anthems at a time, and since it looks like they tier up, you aren't going to be making dynamic choices beyond is my group outputting mostly ranged or melee damage and does this boss deal more physical or tactical (acid vs frost) damage.,
,
Personally, I'd rather have an anthem that lasted 5–10 seconds that made a big impact in a fight, with a CD of 15–25 seconds, so I could use my knowledge of fight mechanics to mitigate a big hit or make my group make a big hit.

,
,It's not the Anthems that tier up, it's the Tale of Tales buff - so now you have to wait for Anthems CDs to reach tier 5,

Personally, the change to Piercing Cry is the one I like the least (or hate the most?). Stance switching would be tolerable if the game were lagless.

					""Piercing Cry only removes corruptions and stuns on critical hits when used in Melody"" That's going to make solo play a lot harder.

					I am playing minstrel since 2008 and this is the second big revamp since release if i recall correctly. Therefore i am wondering what the original idea behind minstrel was and where it is going.  I really love about LotRO that we don't have the holy trinity of tank/dps and heal, but fully viable, needed and fun to play support roles. After dipping my toes in the new Mini build these are the first things i noticed I appreciate and don't like.,
,
,
+ Removing the stuff around Shield Focus was long overdue, thanks for that,
+ the skill resets by call to greatness look useful at first glance,
,
On the other hand:,
,
- losing a support class that could have been a well-rounded alternative to red captain with a little love in the right corners,
- The changes to anthems feel like they become more like complicated ballads, instead of great works of music with real impact ,
- The changes to implement even more substats in buffs/debuffs we can't see in our default character window like acid and frost resistance. Please keep the stats simple and buff/debuff the main stats like tactical/ranged/melee dmg as well as tactical and physical mitigations, inc/outg heal/dmg >> things we can actually see easiliy in our given interfaces and don't confuse new players. ,

Thank you for listening.

					Why? You are killing mini. Have you ever even played with these changes? Blue mini is in a great spot (if played properly). If this goes through you will have one player less, I'm hesitant to log in already because theres literally NOTHING to do at level cap.

					It looks like yellow mini was too hard for yall to balance around, or too complicated to make more engaging. So instead of trying to make significant positive changes, you're just taking it off the table.  This feels remarkablely lazy.  But that's starting to be the theme for ssg lately, isn't it?

,On a positive note, none of the comments we make here will make any difference in the outcome.  The changes are set in stone as per usual.  While it would be nice for a blue name to explain why they are throwing away the yellow mini,  I suspect we will not hear from anyone with any reasons or logic in what is being done here.,
,
,
I wonder what happens to that set of yellow legendary weapons yellow minis spent the time and effort to build?  Will the minis be given something in return to build a new set of weapons or are they on their own to get the proper traceries which will be needed after this update?  Will the logic be ""just reforge""  and wait until you get something useful from the reward track?  I don't see any of that addressed here.,
,
I expect there will be fewer minis in the game if they have to rebuild their legendary weapons using the current game of chance and random tracery drops.

					I am glad Yellow line is going away, it has been useless since the beginning, even before the trait lines. Noone ever played in it, the line was just a means of prebuffing or passive increase to something. The talk about bard identity and red-captain replacement/addition is just a desire of a dps class to push his numbers further, which is not bad on its own, but does not change the fact that Yellow line is a boring 3 buttons buff-bot with bad dps and little healing. It has its place in the groups only because people are overgeared or can't find a red captain. Gameplay wise Yellow is even worse then playing a red captain.,
,
So good riddance and thank you for the change.

OnnMacMahal,"Aug 30 2022, ","
					I appreciate all the feedback, but I also encourage you all to actually hop into Bullroarer and look at the changes yourselves. If you currently play a yellow-spec minstrel, we aren't taking away your tools at all. The goal is to keep everything that makes yellow minstrel great, without penalizing your core healing or damage when making that choice.

Hastran,"Aug 30 2022, ","
					""To that end, anthems all now share a cooldown, have shortened durations, and can only be used in combat."",
,
What this means is instead of clicking other skills you are constantly going back to refresh Anthems and it looks like only having one anthem up at a time.  It is never, never advantageous to players to shorten the duration of Buffs.  I have a hard time seeing how anyone could see it differently...of course, I quit playing my redline Minstrel after Mordor...just too nerfed.
				"
Trixie_Me,"Aug 30 2022, ","
					,
,
,A large part of the reason yellow minis are included in raids is the light debuff.  You've clearly nerfed that reason out of existence.  These changes mean only blue minis will now be welcome in raids.  There is no justification for this.  None.
				"
OnnMacMahal,"Aug 30 2022, ","
					You can still maintain multiple anthems, and though the base duration has been lowered, you can still achieve a nearly 2-minute anthem buff duration. You can also potentially reset anthem cooldowns with Coda of Melody.,
,
This is in the notes and on the skill as well, but the Call of Orome light mitigation debuff stacks with itself twice now, and it has a stronger & longer debuff when used in Melody. You won't be able to achieve the same mitigation reduction you could previously, but the potency of that effect was simply too high for a long-range, AoE, short-cooldown skill.,
,
Damage output for red-line/dissonance has also been increased. Red-line minstrels being brought into a group shouldn't be entirely dependent on one debuff.

,
,I'm currently downloading BR in order to play around with this. I main a red minstrel, so I'm rather intrigued by these changes. Especially given that I tend to work anthems into my build regardless. But I did have some questions while I'm waiting for the download to finish:,
,
1) How significant a DPS increase are we talking here? Most raiders I've talked to in the past year or so do not want a red minstrel in their raids, as there are much better choices for a DPS spot and Minstrels are better used for heals. Will these changes make red minstrels a viable alternative to, say, Hunter or Rune Keeper for ranged DPS?,
,
2) I do know folks who main Protector of Song. It's their bread and butter. These changes are going to impact their builds significantly and will largely put them behind the 8 ball. Are these players going to get any kind of help in reconstructing their LIs to the new build changes? Investing in traceries and such are a time and resource intensive activity. If they're not going to get help for this, you're pretty much asking them to grind harder to fix things.
				"
Arabani,"Aug 30 2022, ","
					,
,
,Is there any tracerie that is yellow line specific in the first palce? Besides you level up a socket, so the progress is sitll here. All you need is a scroll to replace a tracerie. Hardly an issue.
				"
hillard1959,"Aug 30 2022, ","
					,
,
,Not a major issue, no. Depends on what traceries a player has slotted and what their intention was. I think some red minstrels may be a little put off by needing to shoehorn in Anthem traceries if they weren't using them before.
				"
infinitewhimsy,"Aug 30 2022, ","
					Piercing Cry no longer stunning in Dissonance is a bad change. I understand you are trying to add incentive for people to finally use Melody but doing that by paring down the identity of Dissonance/War speech will not make people happy. That definitely seems to be your approach though, for example drastically reducing mitigation reduction offered by Orome (it looks to be about 1/3rd of what it is on live) and then giving a teensy bit of it back in Melody. Of course the difference offered is small but I guess the buff stacks now so you can apply it several times...so you can spend much more time and GCDs to accomplish what you used to do before in 1 skill usage. That seems to be the key idea behind the new Tale of Tales trait too and the new Anthem of Compassion and Free Peoples, recycled but less convenient. And of course you've removed the semi-permanent reflect from Piercing Cry that used to be in Yellow and threw it in with Song of Aid instead... I understand landscape is a joke so who will really have grounds to complain outside of (lol) ""PvPers"", but just in terms of design principles, this kind of approach is stupid aggravating, don't you think? ,
,
But a lot of these changes have a kind of incoherence to then...Call to Greatness now resets Oathbreaker's Shame huh? It's too bad Oathbreaker's applies a 3 minute debuff preventing its use on the same target. Some of the resets are pretty hilarious, nothing like using a 7 minute CD capstone trait to reset a 30s cooldown that is also reset every 25s anyway (Cry of the Wizards). I mean I expect every Warden I'm grouped with to beg me ""please use Call to Greatness, I desperately need to reset Javelin of Deadly Force!"". In case it isn't clear, the joke here is that this is completely useless. ,
,
 And Agility on an Anthem? lol, why don't you bring back Song of Balance while you're at it going backwards a decade via overly specific buffs that do nothing for half the group so you can produce the illusion of choice through skill bloat.,
,
If you want strong identity you should make trade offs count, the fact you can't heal in Dissonance should be worth something more than, idk 15% damage on a few skills? Especially since stance swapping is just a short induction nowadays, skills need to be very different for these stances to feel impactful and like a real choice. I guess Blue Minstrels will be happy (precisely because they make no choices now, they just get everything), but you've blurred the line so heavily between Dissonance and Melody and in such a lazy way that, if anyone ever actually used Melody (lol) I'd imagine both groups would be unhappy. You lost utility in Dissonance and in Melody you are just mediocre at both damage and healing so you can...idk, spam corruption removal with Piercing Cry? Try and fish for Anthem resets which is RNG and a massive time investment and this despite the fact you can maintain 5 Anthems no problem with decent gear so it's totally unnecessary anyway? The only distinctly worthwhile thing I can see in Melody is the trait Strike a Chord, which if anything is annoying to use since it requires spamming Minor Ballads so it's bad for healing (removing your useful ballad buffs) and it requires Melody so it's bad for damage too even though the best time to spam Minor Ballads like this is specialized in Red for traits like ""Haste"" which appear to be bugged anyway and doesn't actually apply the CD reduction with Ballads. Go ahead and try it, the skill lights up as available but you can't use it, the debuff uptime potential is clearly not what it should be. At least it didn't for me on BR.,
,
And in many places this reshuffling slight of hand is done poorly too, so there are instances you are worse off now than you were before. For example you've halved the Attack Duration from Anthem of Prowess and gave 5% to Anthem of the Third Age Resonance....but not Dissonance. Which instead has the significantly worse 5% Light/Fire/Frost damage. If you specialized Yellow and went Red/Dissonance to add DPS and buffs (which is reasonably common in high end content), you are now worse in groups where Prowess was a huge part of the appeal. And of course Anthem of the Free People's is just a worse version of the old Anthem of the Third Age Melody.  Unless I'm missing something we've also lost a 10% Incoming Healing buff to the group with the replacement of Tale of Tales/Anthem of the Third Age Melody with Free Peoples and the new Tale of Tales.,
,
 Also for the record, you also haven't actually made Anthems interesting. They are still mostly just fire and forget, it just takes longer to reach the point where you are constantly reapplying your buffs. I  do like the fact Anthem of the Third Age Dissonance resets Call of the Second Age immediately now with Invigorating Anthems...but the rest of the Anthems offer totally negligible effects, I would go so far as to say they do effectively nothing - - except for Anthem of War which I think actually does do nothing (it says Coda crit chance, but there's no buff). And 5% threat reduction from Anthem of Compassion? You could make it 500% and it'd still be useless with the way threat works in the game today. Why don't you make the buffs offered by Codas stack or actually make Herald's/Dissonant Strike good somehow outside of the raid 4 set? There's a lot of negligible or useless effects/skills that could be made interesting instead of...this.,
,
,
,Your Strike is useless 99% of the time without the HH 4 set bonus. The trait Resonant Piercing Cry is completely useless, if it does something idk what that something is. A 5% increase 5% of the time? If you want to differentiate these skills based on stances to give them a real identity you're going to have to do a lot more. ,
,
Put it this way, the fact Composure gives you a power restore is a clue just how out of touch the dev team is...the same way Perfect Ballad's bonus ( I think there's 2 now in fact) is still a thing or the fact traits like Pause for Breath still exist....Power is simply NEVER a consideration anymore. I'm still seeing a lot of useless traits in the trees. I mean consider how every trait in the first row of Yellow is completely useless to you while  specialized in Red for damage (no, Echoes resistance is not useful 99% of the time, and no Dissonant Strike is not good, I could give details but this post is already too long and these things are obvious to anyone who actually plays this class) so you just need to eat a big bunch of useless traits to get to the parts of the tree that matter. The fact all of this is left over after a comprehensive pass is not encouraging.,
,
Well, I guess we'll see. Historically once it's on BR that's the best and all you're going to get, surprise me SSG. You've made Minstrel stronger, but you haven't made it more interesting. ,
,
By and large you're going to play the exact same way you did except now it takes longer to come fully online with all of your Anthems to have slightly bigger numbers once you do (or not depending on how significant the Orome debuff is, lol).

					...I freakin' like it! Sure it's different and all of us Mini's will need to take some time to read the tooltips, reconfigure our rotations a bit, but I'm impressed! Overall, EVERYTHING feels more powerful. The new Yellow line doesn't require you burn trait point to get to the next tier of traits which is brilliant! Red line, my DPS was CRAZY and I felt more on par with a Hunter. Blue line, while I did not get to test out in a group, it looks great! More fellowship buffs and benefits? Yes please! Several single-target heals can now be group-wide if we choose? Nice! More amazing heals without taking away heals? Awesome! More anthems to play around with? Uh huh, yes! The more anthems you have active the stronger they become! Now I'm feeling like a real bard!,
,
I'm going to suggest that Mini's take screenshots of their trait trees before this goes into effect, not so you can replicate them, but to use as a guide for building the new trait trees. With the same amount of points I ended up with an additional 4-5 traits!,
,
I haven't done much with trying to make a ""Yellow"" mini, but there are definitely some interesting choices. Traits that can change how skills work, but just bump them up, but change how they work! There's some fun flexibility to play around with there!

					So... My red minstrel is definitely doing more damage on BR than on live. Self-healing in dissonance stance is actually effective. You're only able to cast one anthem at a time, which means you need the Anthem Duration tracery to make them worth using at all. Have all your anthems go on cd after casting one is a bit weird. Even with the duration tracery, it feels like anthems take much too long to come off cd.

,Consider the following: purely out of respect for solo play, do you think it's reasonable to take away an extremely iconic, reliable and resettable stun, corruption removal, and damage reflect in Piercing Cry as well third the light damage debuff from Orome in exchange for marginally more PC damage, 5% attack duration, 10% damage, 5% more light damage, 10% more call Call damage BUT ONLY after you get 3 Anthems up which takes about a minute of being in combat? I find that shocking frankly. Especially since you actually want 4 Anthems up (Anthem of War) which means you're missing out on yet something else you used to have until after you do get these shiny new Anthems up. And the fact you can sort of get these effects back by swapping into Melody actually makes it worse because it means even more time wasted trying to do what you did before and in exchange for worse damage in the process. Do you know what the word clunky means?,
,
It's like you said, well...we want to do a give and take....but the give requires a tedious ramp up that probably doesn't actually outweigh what's taken. Obviously Minstrel is 'better' now after spending like 2 minutes in combat, but that's not always the nature of gameplay is it? The stun removal is particularly egregious imo. Just the thought of having to stop and switch into Melody when I want PC to stun something makes me nauseous, what a disgusting gameplay mechanic, all it does is interrupt and annoy the player. And it's not like Anthem usage is somehow interesting now, it just has new artificial barriers to get them up and is still 99% fire and forget for 100 seconds since 4 out of 5 self effects, every one except Third Age, is completely nugatory. Arguably it's actually less interesting now...Anthems are off CD? Use them. It's the opposite of decision making, automatic rotations based on what skills are light up or not.,
,
And it's not like there's only upsides here in long encounters. There are times when you want to reset Call of the Second Age multiple times via Anthem of the Third Age in a small window. You can't do that anymore because it has a 25/20s cooldown. Your AoE potential is reduced. And the reduction in Orome's potency might well outweigh all of these supposed increases, you might reasonably be doing less damage at the end of day outside of a group even when fully buffed. ,
,
,
,In that case I think you forgot something.,
,
And what about Change of Pace? You've removed the Crit Chance buff from heals for damage skills from the trait. I mean you don't have enough trait points for it anymore so who cares, but arguably that could be what makes Melody functional.

					SSG please bring back Symphony of the Hopeful! Heart and Song of Soothing as minstrels have no real way of reducing threat because Still as Death is barred from use 955 of the time!!! Also minstrels do need some type of skill that heals the fellowship some power. It's surprising as the main healer of the game can't heal others power in any way.

					Frankly I don't particularly look forward to learning a new class and being a n00b again so radical changes to the ones I play are not to my liking.,
,
Having several classes being disrupted at the same time and having their rhythms go out of whack 'til I can get a handle on them will be somewhat tiresome.,
,
,
Unless Shield Focus is trashed ofc otherwise it appears to be a exercise in trolling and making assumptions on how we play our characters. Just the resource cost of LI tweaks makes discovering our ""ideal"" builds so much more difficult.  With 99% not having a look see on BR it's going to be another chance to just give up and not bother and resign ourselves to plodding on and forget about cutting edge and the expense that has become. ,
,
But everyone having to get to grips with all of the classes they play is a huge endeavour we are expected to make, just to satisfy the class devs ego's? It's too much for me, it's going to beyond the majority.

,Removing the stun worries me as well. Really don't see any reason why they insist on stance switching. I won't...actually I'm not fast enough to do. I use Melody when I quest with a friend so I can heal them but otherwise it's Dissonance which is natural for a red mini. The whole anthem change sounds rather complicated and I can already see them breaking us for questing. I love my mini but whenever they do changes it hurts because they never consider players who don't have all trait points, are low at virtues and play without the best gear/traceries. Getting really tired of this.

					After respecializing several times I am still wondering why the tier of a few traits have been changed significantly instead of keeping them as close as possible to the current live version to minimize confusion. Is it really necessary to move induction in blue from tier 3 to tier 5+ or anthem duration in yellow from tier 2 to tier 4? ,
,
I understand that you wanted to migrate a few things from yellow to blue but it would have been great to keep the old blue trait icons for the unchanged traits, making it easier to transfer from the old to the new system.

					Anthems currently have a non-shared cooldown of 5 seconds. It is expected that this will change to a 25-second shared cooldown.,
,
Multiple Minstrel skill deeds require the use of specific Anthems X number of times. In the case of the deed involving Anthem of Composure, X=1000.,
,
Since the cooldown is being multiplied by 5x and changing from individual to shared, the value of X for each Minstrel skill deed involving an Anthem ought to be reduced.

					So, now that I've played around with it some more...,
,
Using Anthems in solo play just feels bad. By the time you're able to get up your second Anthem in Dissonance stance the other one is a good way through its duration. In order to get the most out of your anthems, you need to be in Melody stance. Meaning you either stay in that stance and lose over half of your flat Damage bonus that Dissonance gives you, or try to do some stance dancing. Even at a 0.6 second induction, stance dancing can get you killed solo. Either the inductions need to be removed from stances or Melody needs to be excised completely, with its ability to reduce Anthem CDs migrated over to both Dissonance and Resonance stances.,
,
Also, please put the Stun back on Piercing Cry. Losing both the Stun and the corruption removal from Piercing cry is a bridge too far. I can deal with having one less corruption removal skill. Not having a stun is just uncomfortable.

					I've been a Protector of Song specialized Minstrel since 2007 long before the traits split into trees.,

I am shook by this news.  That's ME you're erasing, man! ,
,
But, your explanations for what you want to do and why have me cautiously optimistic.  Sounds like I *should* still be able to play the minstrel I've always wanted to be (in-the-fight buffing, boosting, and un-focused healing).,

But we'll just have to wait and see where all the chips fall of the trait/skill rearrangements.,

I will say that what WILL MAKE ME MAD is if I have to have different trait loadouts for landscaping vs grouping.   I appreciate the value in having the option to swap specs for , performance, but if (as I fear) landscaping in blue specialty is tedious and grouping in red spec is non-viable then that's a total failure IMO.  Changing stances should be all that's needed to adapt one's build to be ,(if not optimal) in any (t1) content!

					Sorry but the new state of anthems is pretty horrific at first glance (time will tell),
,
Anthems are the new LM PETs and that's the most unfun role i've ever seen in this game.,
,
Also they need to understand:,
*  % damage buffs are a joke compared to mit debuffing, they are just additive to our already bloated outgoing damage so basically divide them by more than 3 to get actually damage buffs,
*  mit debuffs are the meta and need to be avail to all support classes in some equal way or classes are gonna be left out of raids, the diff between a mit debug and not having one is NIGHT and DAY on any T3+ content.   NOTHING in here accounts for the nurf to light debuffing, not even close,
,
,
Aren't having all these anthems basically gonna mimic the same problems weapon swapping caused?  The math to figure out damage is gonna CONSTANTLY be changing for every toon? A mini's the new lag monsters?

Elaelin,"Aug 31 2022, ","
					The stun removal on piercing cry is a less than ideal change.  That skill makes landscape activities doable and makes a difference in surviving on landscape.  The play dead skill is only good for landscape so not sure why you are taking that away from us.  Again, that skill makes a difference when questing on landscape and makes some things doable.  It really doesn't hurt anyone.  Some of these changes are OK for instances.  I anticipate going back to the old days where leveling a mini on landscape was anything but fun.  If you are doing that, give us back our medium armor please.  ,
,
Not sure why you are killing off the yellow mini.   The mini currently has 2 opportunities for group content, blue and yellow.  I happen to be one of those minis who plays yellow and stays in yellow line.  With these changes, mini will have limited opportunity to participate in group content and probably only get to heal in instances.  No one ever wants a red mini for DPS.  Mini was in an ok place with the most recent changes.  Now, mini is going to be  limited in surviving solo landscape content.  I don't even want to imagine missions with piercing cry nerfed and still as death rendered useless.  ,
,
If you want to get rid of the multiple buffs just change them to be short duration epic type buffs (sort of like call to greatness started out) that are only good for 10-15 seconds and please don't make us swap stances in the middle of healing during an instance in order to buff or use those skills.  ,
,
This change seems to rely on constant stance swapping while in combat in order to provide group benefit.  I do not see that it will be sustainable in the long term.  It won't be useful for a solo mini on landscape with the you must be in combat first, swap stances, use the anthem, swap stances and go back to combat.  If the mob is alive long enough for the mini to do all those steps, chances are the mini will be dead if not dead already.  It may be helpful in a raid if the minis coordinate who will use which buff but having to swap stances to update an anthem is just another word for a long induction time.  I can only imagine what constant stance swapping will cause with the current server performance issues.  I envision the no swapping stances while in combat being next on the list after this change is implemented.,
,
If you are implementing these changes because of the yellow mini buffs prior to a boss fight and then swapping back to blue, maybe just fix that rather than kill off the yellow mini completely.  This is killing off the yellow mini and allowing the blue line mini a taste of what the yellow buffs currently do.  It expands a bit for a blue line mini, hurts the red line landscape mini (DPS increase is not a trade off for the losses) and kills the purpose and function of a yellow mini.

					Why did you change the induction reduction from Anthem of the Third Age, Quick Melody trait and Follow Up buff from ""-skill induction"" to ""-healing induction""? My Bolster Courage induction went from 0.1s to 0.8s compared to live. This will severely hit blue line's healing output. Description of induction duration buffs is bad throughout the game. Please decide if you want to make -induction duration buffs additive or multiplicative or at least tell the player how it is working. 95% of the playerbase don't even know there is a difference between additive & multiplicative induction duration buffs.

,You can still utilize that 3rd trait line though! Let's say you have a Yellow specialization that dipped into Blue. Okay, specialize in Blue, but then put most of those points into Yellow.

					Can we just go back to the old concept of stances, which is no stances? Every skill and passive was accessible regardless of the War Speech mode. The later only modified the Coda, increased damage and blocked healing.,

Belechael,"Aug 31 2022, ","
					I also am one of those players that do not like drastic changes to a class.,
Having said that, and accepting that nothing we write here will make any difference to the whole endeavor, lets see if we can have some small changes at least!,
 ,
First of all bugs:,
1. There is a trait that reduces the duration of the anthems by 20 seconds. I think it is the Tale of tales.,
2. Raise the spirit and coda in healing do not say how much healing the fellowship gets. It is blank.,
3. Same for the damage reduction for the coda. It is blank.,
4. Thunderous Codas extra buffs. This has got to be a bug, right? Spend 1 trait point for a meager +1% increase has got to be a bug!,
 ,
Second, weird choices:,
 ,
1. Agility for the Anthem of Prowess... seriously??,
2. Giving the melee bonus to the anthem of prowess and the tactical and ranged damage to the anthem of war. Only a red traited minstrel will be able to get both of these anthems, not a blue traited one.,
3. Removing the stun from the piercing cry in warspeach and healing!!! What kind of tests proved this to be game breaking??? It is a fantastic saving tool for solo and I will be really sorry to lose it.,
4. Song of restoration being a targeted skill. With all the lag and the chaos during an encounter you add another effect that will make us lose time just to clear 1 more wound? Easy pass.,
5. So, now we have 5 anthems that we must chose wisely in the heat of battle depending on the situation... are you kidding me??? Every encounter in the game will have a footnote giving instructions as to what anthem to use there, perhaps 2. There is no way that while healing I will be able to figure out what anthem is fading out and what anthem I must use in time in order to keep all of them up! Of course, the excellent players will be able to do that for T4/5 raid content, but are you telling me that this is to make them feel more busy and that you will create content with that in mind??,
6. Call to greatness 7 minute cd. Way to much to even consider taking it. I will wait all the semiprofessional testers to come up with a verdict. No way I am testing this for every class it affects.,
7. Same with song of aid. The healing seems small, so it must be the negate effect that is so powerful that it dictates a 3 and a half minutes cd.,
 ,
Third, where the minstrel is heading with these changes:,
 ,
1. Blue traited minstrel for healing with some anthem usage.,
2. Red traited minstrel for solo,
3. Red traited minstrel for fellowship play with all the anthems,
4. Blue traited minstrel for fellowship play with almost all the anthems.,
 ,
Are 3 and 4 supposed to be used while in Melody stance? Is this your intended gameplay? Thsi will require a 4th trait configuration (100mc) that I am not willing to spend before someone else comes with the must have traits for specific encounters. I have tried the Red traited melody minstrel (I don't think there is a point to talk about yellow minstrels anymore, you either trait red melody or blue melody), but it will require a lot of fellowship play to reach a verdict whether this is something that will earn a place as a dps/support in raids. Blue/support with both anthems of war and prowess will cripple our healing, and as it will require a 4th configuration I don't think it will work for the majority of players and situations imho.,
 ,
Tldr:,
 ,
Some few bugs, a lot of weird choices, a dps/support (old speech: yellow) minstrel looks to be good.,
 ,
Verdict:,
 ,
As I said I don't like drastic changes, especially to a class that was working good with one great role in fellowship play and very nice soloing capabilities. I am afraid that wanting to give the minstrel another sure spot in a raid will make things complicated and it is not something that the majority of players will be happy with, or even bother. If it was up to me I would concentrate on fixing several small things in ALL THE CLASSES, balancing the whole fellowship environment, polishing and ironing some other things, instead of a major overhaul of the minstrel class.,
 ,
But what do I know, right?,
,
PS. Are you planning to do the same thing with the Brawler’s and Minstrel’s yellow tree to the other classes as well? Hunter, guardian, champion and perhaps captain and warden could benefit from such a change, but the uproar would be huge for some of them ,

					I imagine the point of starting with minstrel here is two fold.  One, they want to see how players react to having trait lines stripped out, and two, they want to stop stance/line swapping for raid buffs.  ,
A lot of these changes don't feel bad to play, and probably wont effect raid viability for the minstrel.  You'll still want a mini in raids, no debate necessary.  ,
,
The problem isnt the buffed damage or the buffed heals.  The problem is they could have made a lot of these changes without cutting out yellow as a specialized line.  Instead of trying to fix the identity problems of yellow line, they'd rather just take away part of the minstrel's identity as a whole.  The dedicated support lines are a standout part of lotro, that other MMOs like WoW and ff14 just dont have.  This isnt an update for the players, this is a quality of life update for the devs, who have had trouble balancing three trait lines on each class since trait trees were first introduced.  Thats why this feels lazy.  Its just easier for them to justify taking more from the player base by ""buffing"" the class.  A lot of players will probably enjoy this change though.  They'll do more damage in runs, and they'll heal more.  The class will just be more tedious to play, but the average player wont care.  Increasingly shallow game play design will be forgotten when players see the bigger numbers. ,
,
If they want to go the route of reducing trait lines on each class down to 2, theyre going to do it anyway.  Our feedback here wont matter.  If it did, the outrage over the reputation scrolls would have elicited a response, we wouldnt have issues obtaining the correct traceries (and no, the delving system isnt fixing the problem. they could have just put tokens to choose the traceries in instances instead of random drops. delving system is to encourage people to use missions, which have flopped), and the hidden hoard raid on t3+ wouldnt be in the state it is. ,
,
I just want them to stop pretending like this is for us, and come out and say they plan to strip down the trait tree system.  Stop playing coy.  And dont try to just do this one class at a time.  If you want to change the system in a major way, do it for all the classes at once.  Tear off the bandaid.  One class at a time will just make going from one class to the next feel awkward.

LoraE,"Aug 31 2022, ","
					I transferred my level 140 mini over to Bullroarer, adjusted her traits, and then ran a few solo things to test out some of the changes. She is a character I have been playing since 2010 and one of my favorites. ,
,
I am not a fan of these anthem changes. They are an important part of playing a mini solo. Only being able to play one anthem at a time forces us to choose between a buff that boosts our survivability or a buff that boosts our damage. Additionally, trying to manage the anthem buffs every 25ish seconds isn't easy when you are trying to kill things and stay alive. There is not an easy way to see what buffs needs to be refreshed in the heat of battle. And not being able to play them out of combat also makes things difficult - when you have your anthem CD almost ready and your last enemy you are currently fighting dies, they are immediately greyed out. This is frustrating when are trying to move through an area. ,
,
These changes DO NOT make anthems more interesting to use. It makes them more frustrating. It makes them MORE of a chore. The anthem cooldowns are just terrible. ,
,
Perhaps, if it was desired to make anthems more dynamic or whatever, we had some sort of element  (like the warden gambit meter) that would allow us to put in three anthems. Then if we played a 4th anthem, it would override the spot of the 1st anthem. This would make it easy to see what anthems are active and change them out depending on the circumstances. ,
,
I also do not like removing the stun from piercing cry. It is also something that is important to our survivability while soloing. Switching stances during combat isn't an answer to this problem either. I only switch if I'm grouped with someone and they really need a heal.,
,
Regarding the changes to yellow stance - I didn't have a chance to test that out in a group setting. I played around with a red trait tree and a blue trait tree- I was able to get lots of yellow traits in both these set ups. I have played some in a yellow/blue set up on live - it seems you could as well. But I haven't run a lot of group content lately so I may not be the best judge of that.,

					Playing an Anthem every 20 Seconds or so to keep tiering up the Tales Buff and keeping up a rotation to be able to play them on CD feels a little bit like yellow LM where you are keeping up your Debuffs and Pet Rotation in similar just a little bit more hectic timeframe, and I enjoy yMinstrel, because you have more opportunities to react to situations and have time between your Buffs(Anthems) to do something else and be more than a Buff machine. I love my yLM, but I don't want to play two classes that are too similar. The long durations of Anthems gives us opportunities.

					Okay so here's my experience with the changes. Will be focusing on only the changes that affect blue minstrel.,
,
About me: I'm a minstrel main and have done the highest tier raids for the past couple years and have been among the first groups on my server to complete them. All that is to say I have a lot of experience on the class and know how to play it.,
,
I went back to Lotro and hit the training dummy for a few minutes to get an average parse. Using Anvil set, 3 yellow raid set, induction cloak, 2 new crafted induction crafted traceries and ranged heal extension (replaced with inductions on beta to give it a fighting chance). I averaged 170-180k on myself. Here's the skill breakdown of one of them:,
,
,
,
Note that Bolster is the most used heal and the fast inductions allow me to use more perfect endings, so it's higher in the list. There's also not a single , being used (a lot of people seem to ignore that its a bad skill but it is),
,
Now compare this to what I got in a few minutes on bullroarer (it's not perfect, but I don't have hours of time to perfect this super slow rotation). Results on a dummy are 125-135k. That is , up and I swapped my ranged extension tracery to skill inductions and anthem of war for cry of the chorus tracery.,
,
,
,
,
This is a difference of around 50k hps for 3 minutes, which will probably get bigger if you use all anthems. It's roughly a ,
It feels extremely slow even when using every induction bonus possible. It’s also a huge nerf because you don't get as many Perfect Endings off, which is one of the best single target heals, because the building of Snowball is slower. ,
,
,
,
I struggle at understanding why you got rid of the Cry of the Chorus reset for blue line only. With a cooldown of 57s (with tracery) you can’t even keep up the +3% incoming healing buff from Coda of Resonance (on live its 5%, I wonder why you nerfed it) for the fellowship unless you use ballads.. It feels like you try to force minis to use ballads, but Ballads are just bad. 8m range, relatively long animation, the heal is far from strong and you might as well use a Soliloquy instead. If you want us to use Ballads, then make them worth using. Also the incoming damage on Coda of Resonance was nerfed from 10% to 5% and no longer stacks. This makes Ballad/Coda spamming worse as well.,
,
,
,
Its extremely frustrating to have to take the time to use these Anthems every 20s, especially if you are in a raid and someone needs focus heals, but you have to hit an anthem instead in order to keep all of them up cleanly. You say it gives flexibility, I don't see that. Being forced to rotate anthems every 25s is not fun game design.,
,
,
,
, ,
Minis healing on live is in a good spot, it’s arguably the best 6 man healer. It's better than rk healers in many ways, but not overpowered. So I don't understand why these changes are affecting blue mini. Slowing down inductions is fine, although I don't personally like it. If you want to go that route, heals must be compensated elsewhere and I am not seeing that. Also being forced to rotate anthems every 25s is not fun game design.,
,
The proposed mini changes right now are horrid. You are making blue mini no longer fun to play and nerfing its healing capability. Please keep it fun to play and don’t turn blue mini into a support healer taken only for its buff. Mini has always been a strong pure healer with good buffs. I see blue mini easily being replaced in raids, because red mini can do the buffs and you can just bring a better healer like rk or bear. But red mini dps is also bad, but that’s for another day ,

					Hey hey! ,
,
I am super excited and glad to be seeing new changes, and new things being added to one of my favorite games and one of my favorite classes.  I think first and foremost it is important to accept that change is necessary for growth in a game, and in ones character development. I believe we would all be silly to think the classes are staying the same forever... however lets talk about these changes and the issues they bring. I hope you can listen and read each and every one of these concerns because trust us, some of us have truly put in the time playing and testing and however good it may sound on paper, playing them in the game.... it doesn't work. ,
,
,
,
,
Bugs/Tool-Tip Issues/etc:,
,
1. The tooltip for Raise the Spirit still is reading a heal over time, however it is acting like mentioned in the patch notes, a ""small AOE heal after a brief delay"". This is still confusing especially when referring to traceries that have to do with AOE heal vs HOT crit etc. Please correct this!,
2. Raise the Spirit AOE heal also doesn't have a value on it just shows a cooldown before expiring.,
3. Anthem of Prowess has a global CD of 15s where the others have a global CD of 20s (with traits + traceries). If you use prowess before the others it actually is lowering the global cooldown for the rest of the anthems as well. This doesn't seem to be correct.,
,
,
,
Main Issues/Concerns:,
,
1. As a few others have mentioned I am pretty confused by the anthem of prowess giving agility seems to be quite a waste of a stat.,
,
2. Referring to prowess, I am quite confused why melee bonus is now split from Anthem of War. If you're trying to balance more and make it more streamline why now break it apart and make it more difficult and more steps? Further more on this note, given this update, people are taking more hunters over champs anyway, so are you just wanting us to not play with Anthem of War? If anyone who has even logged in to play and test would now know you pretty much have to go fully into red to even be able to touch Anthem of War, leaving out the most important stuff from the Protector of the Song traits (CTG, SOA, etc etc.) Your words, ""Our goal is not to remove yellow line or yellow line’s identity, but to fold yellow line back into being a core part of the minstrel, accessible regardless of whether you’re in red line doing landscape quests, blue line main-healing a raid"" hold actually the exact opposite value after testing because we are now left with choosing do we: ,
,
a. heal with very little anthem use ,
b. red dps only ,
c. red all anthems ,
d. blue most anthem and throw points wherever. ,
,
3. Piercing Cry stun? Lets all agree change that back and everything will be fine. Seriously.. please just revert it. It doesn't make sense. Referring back to what was previously said. Instead of ""folding yellow in"" you are now forcing us to stay melody to use certain skills? Again.. please change this back for all the healing minis out there. <3,
,
4. Lets talk useless traits // the way the trait obtaining process works. If you want us to stay Resonance and Watcher and Heal, how can we heal and get CTG/Tale/SOA/Anthem duration etc when its all at the bottom filtered in with useless stuff like the breakout/the coda etc etc. Seems like since everything has been merged to be used in Melody stance having some of the stuff that we could actually benefit be near the top rather than the bottom. Breakdown of what I mean below. ,
,
- Echoes of Battle would be cool to see it effecting something in Resonance, not just the other stances. Or wait... do you want us to just play Melody?,
- The third row on Protector of Song seems to be a massive point waster where one has to decide how to get to the bottom. ,
,
a. Tactical Mastery is either take all or take none because the only useful bonus is the tact mit. ,
b. Prowess.. I guess we take it ,
c. Song of Restoration, pretty useless,
d. Word Spreads again useless unless you take all the way, and we don't have the points for that. ,
,
5. Induction speeds have now been nerfed? Why was this change implemented? Still would love to find out taking the flat ""induction speeds"" to now ""healing induction speeds"" really has slowed the class way down. Slowing the heals on top of the anthems (see next note) really has made the class feel SUPER sticky, and slow to play. ,
,
6. Lets talk anthems. Since we can't even try to get anthem of war without literally losing every thing in Protec of Song, we now have 5. I am actually not mad at their being more, that doesn't bother me one bit. I am okay with adapting to learn to rotate them, etc etc. Here is where the main issue comes into play. ,
,
A. Cooldowns of the ANTHEMS. Why are they shared? This literally makes no sense to any of us. I understand one could argue that you don't want us to pop them all stand and heal and seem to be doing nothing, however now have to rotate them and not provide as much heals seem to be going against what you were trying to accomplish.,
,
I believe one solution to this method would be to implement a new trait in place of Invigorating Anthems. Lower the anthem cooldowns back to what they were, and maybe changing Invigorating to allow each tier to unlock an additional anthem. Again this would be a rather new change compared to what you guys have, however that still limits how many you can throw at once if you don't have all the traits into it etc.,
,
New Invigorating Anthems,
Allows the use of multiple active anthems for the entire raid,
Rank 1: 1 Active anthem,
Rank 2: +1 Active anthem,
Rank 3: +2 Active anthem ,
Rank 4: +3 Active anthem,
,
This would allow your guys new idea to be more represented. We as minstrels would have to adapt based on the fight and decide which 4 of the 6 anthems we would want to use. Where as now we are trying to keep them up in order every 20s doing very minimal healing.,
,
7. CTG cooldown 7 minutes? It seems to be a little long? Maybe include something like Hunter Rain of Arrows cooldown where critical heals or something reduces the cooldown slightly? ,
,
8. Cry of the Chorus Reset. Again, another crucial piece to minis that seem to us as a very odd choice to remove. It seems as if you want us to spam ballads/Coda however you guys also nerfed that (incoming damage) from 10%-5% creating all the more reason to not do that. ,
,
,
,
Closing Remarks:,
,
As a mini main, and high end raider who has done pretty much all content from 100+ I really want to like these changes. I want to support them, and truly figure out how to work around them. However the more time spent on BR (trust me we've spent too much already) we keep finding the same issue. Or better yet we have the same question.,
,
Do you want us to heal, or support?,
,
With these new changes if they make it to live, minis will no longer to successfully heal and provide a streamline system when it comes to buffing their fellowship or raid. We will now have to decide not only what anthems we want for our group and try to keep them up, but we will now have to decide what exactly to do. Do say screw anthems, trait blue and stay in Resonance and try to heal? Or do trait blue, stay in Melody and support? Or lastly do you want us to just go Red now, with every anthem and be a full support? ,
,
Our main concern and question would be if you want us to still be viable to the healing realm in the same degree we are now, without it being slow, clonky, and down right not enjoyable, changes have to be made to what we just tested. ,
,
Thanks for reading <3

,You can't use anthems out of combat anymore so there is no such thing now. It takes about 2 minutes to get all of your Anthems up now, same thing with maxed Tale of Tales. All of these things you effectively had instantly before. ,
,
In many ways both Tale of Tales and the Anthems are worse now too. You lost -5% attack duration on Prowess for example. It's been moved to Third Age Resonance instead, which means you don't get it at all if you want to be DPS and buff. Third Age Resonance itself also lost 5% Induction reduction. Of course if you were strictly blue line as a Minstrel you get a fair amount of new buffs, but they definitely come with a heavy price. The loss of CotC CD and Inspiring Cries & Calls for example.,
,
,
,
,This is an underappreciated angle I think. On live I use Coda a lot more when healing because I can immediately get back into 3 Ballads with CotC and it gives the tank 10% damage reduction through Improved Coda of Resonance on top of the 5% Incoming Healing buff to the group, which you can maintain permanently without using a single ballad. ,
,
I'm not going to do this after the changes, because not only does CotC have a much longer CD now, you can no longer reset that cd with Inspiring Cries & Calls which has been removed. This means Improved Coda of Resonance is worse now too, I probably won't be traiting it anymore because you don't want to Coda while healing now unless CotC is up since it means a large loss of time/healing having to spam Major Ballad (which sucks), so at most you do it once a minute. Which of course also means losing the 5% Incoming Healing buff from the Coda at least half of the time.,
,
The buffs from Thunderous Codas are kind of amusing because of this, having to trait for a worse version of what you once had by default (seems to be the major theme of these changes) and the HoT added to your Coda is totally negligible. This trait is only good in Redline because you want to regularly use Minor Ballad in red, you do NOT want to use Major Ballad while blue, and of course Red line still has its CotC reset via Improved Coda of Fury.,
,
,
We got the trait Inspiring Finish instead in Blue...I don't foresee anyone using it. Not least of all because we likely don't have the points for it, and because it's pretty bad. The duration is short, the effect is small, and the time investment and opportunity cost are massive.  I don't even think the average Minstrel will have trait points for Anthem of War anymore in blue, which definitely makes the new yellow tree less appealing. You're losing plenty to get this new stuff, which requires a lot more time to setup and maintain - - time spent not healing and thus falling behind on healing. I didn't really think about point allocation before because the yellow traits seemed so cheap but I was definitely wrong before when I said at least the blue minstrels will be happy with the changes. ,
,
Eyeballing it and predicting how I'll trait on BR...you're losing all of the following in Blue:,
- 70k morale from Enduring Morale,
- Anthem of War (simply not enough points),
- CotC reset via Inspiring Cries & Calls,
- 30s CD on CotC,
- 100% uptime on Coda Resonance Fellow buff  (5% incoming healing),
- 10% incoming damage reduction through Improved Coda of Resonance (which you won't use anymore),
- 10% induction reduction from Anthem of the Third Age Resonance,
- Call to Earendil debuff is now 1/3rd of what it used to be,
- Legend of Helm Hammerhand is now significantly weaker,
- Anthem of Composure is now significantly weaker (Resistance Rating is like 1/3rd of what it was, tact mit loss is compensated for if you also do Anthem of Compassion to cover all tactical types...so more trait points and GCDs for less),
,
And all of this is in exchange for,
-  the new Song of Aid,
- Anthem of the Third Age Resonance now gives your group a minor buff,
- Anthem of Prowess (with halved attack duration, the important part),
- Anthem of the Free Peoples,
- Call to Greatness (which is still useless for half of its effects),
,
And all of this is assuming we don't also stay in Resonance, which most will, which means losing the stun and corruption removal in PC too. Remember, they didn't JUST remove it from DPS builds, you will no longer have it while healing unless you switch into Melody which...why the hell would you? For the lower heal numbers? For the paltry Finesse bonus on the Anthem? To fish for Anthem resets with RNG procs that cost huge amounts of resources even though you can maintain 5 Anthems without it? So you are forced to use another 2 seconds reapplying Melody of Battle? So you can then have the pleasure of then switching OUT of Melody? Yay for for time wasting ridiculous inductions you're forced to juggle back and forth to retain your past functionality, lol. ,
,
I don't think I'd make that trade given the choice. The more I look at the changes the more I am convinced they are bad for every Minstrel playstyle, that's pretty impressive in itself.,
,
Suggestion: You should remove Melody as a stance and instead make it a decaying buff that changes the effects of skills imo, but also change those effects because currently they are aggravating, it's just giving us back some of what you took away. The effects should be damn more substantial too, if you keep it as modifier for the Orome debuff duration it should be much more than 10s, just increase the CD of Melody to compensate. Quit being such Indian givers, SSG.

					Whoa.. I never thought about this! You're onto something I remembering doing the Anthem of Composure deed it was torturous.. and that was with the 5s cooldown imagine now. They will have to definitely reduce the amount of times its needed for the deed.

					so Anthem of the Third Age Resonance was nerfed too? The induction buff and healing buff from it are lower? If this is the case it's going to be harder for healers to be more effective at healing which is defintely not good at all! Also i feel like only those near end game will have enough points to benefit from the yellow line trait points now since you cant specialize it from the beginning. That's a bummer :/

					Playing since launch, haven't logged in the forums for years and years now, but I needed to for this one.,
I am an experienced mini, did almost all raids in T2-T3. Meaning: I know a few stuff about minis.,
,
,
,
Blue and Yellow minis were in a good shape. Some tweaks needed here and there, especially on Yellow but all in all, in a good spot.,
,
Nobody asked for a major overhaul to Mini.,
Why are you changing a core class, with unneeded, unwanted changes?,
Why the overhaul? ,
Nobody asked for this overhaul. Why would you waste time with this?,
,
,
,
And why a change for the worse? ,
Anthems now are a boring spam fest. At least pre-whatever-this-travesty-is, we could fire Anthems and forget about them. With these changes, it's a spam fest.,
If you want to change Yellow, change and improve Yellow.  Keep yellow as it is in Live, but improve it. Tweak it. ,
Don't remove yellow.,
And definately don't destroy Blue and Red to make Yellow work.,
,
,
,
I take it you don't like how minis play but most mini players were happy with the playstyle. Content.,
If you don't like how minis play, don't play them.,
,
What is this need to remove what players enjoy, so late in the game's life cycle? Why remove options for players to play with (two trait lines instead of 3) ?,
You're just alienating paying customers for no good reason, and with changes for the worse, not for the better.,
,
,
I apologize if I seem harsh but seriously, we like minis as it is. ,
It's not too late to turn back. Don't go ahead with this pointless change for the worse.,
Seriously, if I were your boss, I'd would applaud the effort but I would veto it.,
,

PS - I know this is worthless because SSG never changes anything substancial due to feedback, unfortunately.

					Feels like a lot of these responses are knee jerk reactions without spending time on bullroarer. I think this is a really positive change. Yellow wasn't a particularly fun spec to play imo and this allows minstrels a lot more freedom in fulfilling their role while being able to take more stuff in yellow due to the changes in point costs. I like the idea of yellow as a utility tree to assist and customize the way you play red or blue.,
My main feedback would be that it honestly feels bad not being able to put up at least one anthem before a fight starts. I get the need for ""ramp up time"" but idk. It is frustrating to be several seconds into a fight before you even consider a 2nd anthem. ,
The removal of the PC stun in red war speech is tough. It's been an iconic part of red mini for a long time. Not sure I'm a fan of losing it.,
Finally small thing to ask but I was very excited to see anthem of the free peoples return. But was disappointed when i found out it no longer grants the HoT that it used to grant when you used Coda with the anthem active.
				"

					,
,
,Former Coda cash out effects are applied automatically now upon using an Anthem if you trait Invigorating Anthems, you get a HoT from Anthem of the Free Peoples, it's about 30-40k personal heal over 10s (ie, negligible, like all of the other effects from the trait except for Third Age).

				"
infinitewhimsy,"Aug 31 2022, ","
					,
,
,Yeah it's a real shame all but 1 of the Anthem effects are totally worthless.,
5% Threat Reduction via Compassion,
3 Herald Strikes with no CD via Prowess,
Tiny self HoT via Free Peoples,
Power Restore via Compassion,
Coda Crit Chance via War (seems to be bugged since there's no buff, but would be lackluster even if it worked),
,
The effects are anything but noticeable, they all effectively affect nothing. ,
,
Power and Threat are no longer considerations at end game (like, at all), Herald's Strike is a worthless skill most of the time (the HH 4 set changes that, but the buff doesn't stack so why do you need to apply it 3 times in a row? lol), you don't want to Coda at all in Blue now and the heal it gives isn't even good so a marginally higher crit chance isn't exactly exciting.,
,
My suggestion:,
Change the effects to something like...,
,
Anthem of War - Next Coda is now guaranteed to Crit.,
Prowess - Your next Piercing Cry is now AoE (I would be willing to swap into Melody for this kind of moment, this would feel impactful to AoE stun/corruption removal from ranged),
Compassion - Resets the cooldown on Chord of Salvation ,
Composure -  Your next Ballad is twice as effective,
,
And while you're at it change it so incrementing or refreshing Tale of Tales (that is, casting an Anthem) reduces the cooldown slightly on Song of Aid. These kinds of changes would make Minstrel feel more dynamic and interesting.,
,
,
,
,Even if I don't like the current changes I think it's obvious Yellow line had problems. The old playstyle of just using your Anthems every 3 minutes wasn't exactly fun either you know? It was convenient though.
				"
WeirdJedi,"Aug 31 2022, ","
					,
,
,I will admit that I'm not on Bullroarer to get a feel for the changes, but I think a lot of these changes are good. I really didn't like the idea of prepping anthems before battle and disliked the expectation of minstrels temporarily switching to the yellow trait line to cast buffs before the raid advances. Any one of the changes - especially making it so you have to cast anthems during a fight - would have solved that problem. But I see why people are upset about it because my captain's Oath-keepers was changed awhile back so , could only be cast in-combat. This prevented me from spending that extra second casting it beforehand. In the end, I realized that it wasn't , big of a deal. However, I don't like how Call of Greatness refreshes the ability without the 3-minute debuff also clearing away on the enemy. ,
,
I also really like the idea of blurring the lines. Healing was very pitiful in red and there was very little you could do for damage in blue (even when switching stances). From the looks of it, they are also trying to make anthems flexible so you can coordinate multiple minstrels in a raid. Then again, there are so many different opinions on the matter that it is hard to tell from a glance.

,Actually people have spent a lot of time on bullroarer testing it and the changes are garbage. Losing 25% ogh, inductions, coda -damage reduction, piercing cry stun/CR removal, legend of the hammerhand nerf, all to gain CTG reset for 3 skills (on two classes) is ####. They are turning a main healer into a support class and people ####ing hate it.

Faudyen,"Aug 31 2022, ","
					Was able to hop on Bullroar for a bit today.,
My first concern is that for the landscape solo red mini there is no reason to spec into or use any anthem.  The fights are over before you can build up to use them.,
This would register to  me the same if I was leveling up.  My concern here is that when a mini reaches end game they all of a sudden have to learn a new way to play.,
As a solo red mini I had a lot of points that I was putting anywhere because they didn't matter.   ,
Song of aid cooldown is far too long.  Song of aid is way at the bottom of a tree, costing a lot of points.  The heal is about the same as inspire fellows.  The hot on song of aid is a joke, yet is has a 3 1/2 minute cooldown.  I'm not a raid healer, granted, but as someone that has no problem going blue for friends to knock out a couple of instances I would not put any points into this.,
Induction time on bolster courage should be reduced.  ,
The CotC nerf to blue line is unnecessary.,
With all of changes you have made I'm bit surprised that there is still an induction between stances.  This should be removed.,
The removal of stun on piercing cry was a bad choice.  Minis have never been an amazing dps class and this ability has kept many a mini alive over the years.  It should be returned.,
My feeling on melody stance is the same as before I played the beta.  In my opinion, go to dissonance and  resonance stance.  Keep the coda in dissonance the damage it is now but add the aoe and heal from melody and get rid of melody.  In my opinion when you are in a 3 man or 6 man you are either dps or you are healing, how often are people trying to do half of both?  Our with your friends?  Same thing, you are one or the other.  Most classes (sorry red brawler) can heal themselves redline.  You want to switch to blue stances after a fight, toss a couple of heals and move back, cool.  I just don't see a point of yellow stance anymore.  ,
Thanks

					I just realized the group effect from Anthem of the Third Age Resonance isn't applied to the Minstrel. So you're actually losing 10% Induction Reduction with the changes to the Anthem....wow, I'm speechless. That is so much worse than I thought, and I thought it was bad before. ,

					I guess a Monster player is going to love the changes.,

Nothing on landscape survives my red mini long enough for him to cast an anthem. I had to fear mobs to delay their deaths just to add an anthem. Should I ask for it's CD to be lowered to 20 seconds to enable anthem use?,
,
The more damage I do the more time I have to twiddle my thumbs waiting. If I want to attempt to buff with anthems any more that is. Bye-bye Warspeach, hello anthems I can't use except in a metronomic 20 second cycle of pulls across the map or mission. Kill me now!,

					It would be nice to know why these changes/nerfs to the mini are needed.  If the true intent is to introduce yellow line to those that only play blue and red line it falls short of the goal as the new (not really improved) buffs will be a choice under the new system.  Yes, we will be able to put points into those yellow line skills but no, we won't have the time to use these new skills in blue or red line on a consistent basis.  Add to that longer inductions, reduced heals and the mini will have fewer opportunities for group content and solo landscape activities will be a chore.  ,
,
I am not sure why you don't just leave the red and blue lines as they are and if you really want to get rid of yellow minis just open up the line as is currently.  Let that be tested on live servers for a bit and then decide what nerfs are necessary.  The current proposed changes only offer a watered down version of the potential of a yellow mini.

Healing parses are stupid. Unless you're comparing performance in an actual encounter/boss/instance the numbers are worthless, there's a lot of factors that determine how much you heal for, with what skill, and how often.,
,
 That being said I am sure the healing output is lower because they nerfed CotC  cd while removing the reset on top of nerfing our induction buffs and Coda...and obviously you have less time TO heal now because you need to use Anthems a lot more and or swap into ######## Melody for a stun or Orome, but who knows if that isn't outweighed by things like the new Song of Aid damage reduction or -10% attack duration from Prowess/Resonance on the group letting you shorten the encounter or better deal with mechanics via higher DPS or the group simply taking less damage because of new Anthems stats like 5% Orc Craft mitigation on Prowess. You don't want to measure HPS, you want to measure impact, which isn't as simple.

					I suspect that these changes are set in stone.  The best we can hope for at this point is a tweak here and there.  Customer comments here rarely result in anything actually changing.  At this point we probably need to stick to begging for piercing cry to keep its stun and corruption removal in any stance and any improvements/adjustments to cool downs, inductions, etc.  Maybe the comments will make small differences but I don't see this actually changing anything major.    The yellow mini will have a new name/look and the choices will be spam mediocre buffs on long cool downs, lesser heals or mediocre dps.  It is still three choices just not as well rounded or effective as things are today.  Minis will have awesome tool bars and available skills but will have to choose which ones will be used as there is not enough time to use them all fully.  On a positive note, I suspect we will see more classes nerfed shortly.  Look at all those comment threads out there.  Hopefully SSG will nerf the instances and landscape mobs to match the reduced skills of our classes.

					I feel ill.  Seriously.  These changes, specifically those taking away functions, the ones that are nerfing us, are horrible.  The mealy-mouthed ""rationalizations"" for this mess are disgusting.  Either you think you can hoodwink us with your ""reasoning"" or you have no actual clue how the class functions currently.  ,
,
I've read through the entire thread, and while I might have missed a criticism or two, most that I did read are spot on.  ,
,
Adding to the ill feeling is the knowledge that, unless SSG has had a sudden about face, there is NOTHING that will be changed.  To say it's NOT set in stone is directly contradicted by all the times SSG has suddenly introduced changes via Bullroarer, invited feedback yet totally ignored the feedback they receive, and two weeks later, the changes go live.  And those changes are almost never adjusted except in the very most minor way, unless they discover they forgot to nerf something.  THAT they will ""adjust"".  SSG, you think this is harsh?  It's truth, and if you think being told the truth is ""harsh"", then so be it. This is a fair and accurate depiction of your past record of how you have operated, for as long as it's been SSG, and going back before that too.  ,
,
Even if I thought the changes were beneficial, this is a huge daunting amount of relearning to do.  As another poster put it, going back to being a noob again, learning a class all over.  Admittedly, I'd have more enthusiasm for it IF the changes were beneficial, but they're first and foremost ANOTHER NERF to minstrels.  You have a really peculiar business model: Look for ways to make your customers unhappy.

					I copied over a level 65 and level 106 minstrel, and tried them both out in solo play, red spec'd, with additional points in yellow. I use a plugin that measures combat time in seconds. I found no significant difference in combat time between Dissonance and Melody stance, at best I might occasionally end combat 1 second faster in Dissonance. For normal mobs, neither stance had any significant difference. For signatures, Dissonance sometimes took longer because I had to heal to stay alive -- that was a non-issue in Melody. I also solo'd the Attack at Dawn skirmish, setting it to 2-man, running Melody. The final boss required using all healing skills including coda and strike, and was still close, but definitely doable. I don't think I would have had a chance in Dissonance -- without the additional healing from coda and strike, I don't see any way I could have survived.,
,
So for solo play, melody stance gives the stun to Piercing Cry, further reduces mob resistance, and provides additional healing for tougher situations, for what appears to me to be an insignificant amount of additional combat time, and slightly less post combat time healing up for those who like to take on something more challenging then a single normal landscape mob.,
,
As for anthems when soloing landscape, I never had more than one up -- combat just doesn't last long enough. Against signatures, if I had the three ballads up and piercing cry stunned them, I could always cast Third Age and then finish the combat. That meant I had the anthem up for any additional mobs that I could engage in the next couple of minutes.,
,
I can't speak to raiding or healing, but for solo play the changes are great once you switch to Melody stance -- faster kills, ability to tackle tougher content, and coda/strike actually worth being on your toolbar.

					Yes, I like the changes in general. Except for the Anthems, of course. Most of them are realtively useless (5% increase is not a flat increase for instances) and keeping several up is not fun, neither is the new Invigorated/cashe out mechanic. The way I see it is that in most cases Minis will play in Melody, keep a couple of ""the most useful"" anthems up and almost never cash them out.

,This. I rarely use more than two anthems, Anthem of War and Anthem of Composure, while soloing. They're not even needed most of the time, but really nice to have when tackling solo dungeons. Now getting those buffs up and maintaining them are a chore.,
,
I can see using Melody stance while specced into Warrior-Skald for a more AOE-centric build. That's actually pretty cool. I just want them to fix the anthems. And give me my stun back.

					I wrote out a much longer post, but at page 4 of mini feedback, there isnt much going to be said thats original. So heres to being short and sweet, unlike these changes that are long and....not so sweet.,
,
-it seems that minis will be either spending all of their time spamming ballads and coda to reset cds and keep up anthems with minimal healing, or spend time healing with our long inductions and reduced hps at the cost of crippling our buffing capabilities. ,
-most of the anthems dont even make sense - random stats like agility or orc craft mits? separating melee and ranged/tact dam buffs? were just adding random things to each one to make them seem new and different, but its just all the old ones spread out across 5 ,
-the piercing cry changes are a way to force minis to stay in melody. if you want us to use a skill or a stance, make it useful and we will even when given other options. ,
-ctg resetting oathies but oathies gives a 3min debuff on the mob and ctg is on a 7min cd. unless you have twin bosses this feels great at first glance, but is useless on application.,
,
Im confused at the vision the devs have for the mini. On live, they fill the role of the main healer, but on BR maybe like a second rate cappy or lm. These changes dont feel like they were made by people who play the class or have an understanding of what groups/players look for in a healing class.,
,
Thanks infnintewhimsy and gladenn and others, I agree with all of the comments that youve made and the suggested fixes as well. ,
,
Also, mildly offended at whoever said no one is on BR testing. Minstrel is a beloved class that has had some great improvements over the years and some of us have spent an embarrassing amount of hours on BR testing the changes.

First off all, good morning !! ,
,
And wow... what a work !!  At the beginning, I was a bit scared of all this changes ! And when I logged in Bullroarer, and started to check the differents traits, i discovered how much good changes, that was ! I didn't really loose my heals skills, and got some nice buff with it ! Thank you, for those additions !,
,
Although... even if the fact that doing the buff only when in combat doesnt bother too much, i got some trouble with CD shared wuth the anthems. If i'm not wrong, the max CD i got was 20sec shared... with a bit less than 2min anthems... If we want to buff our allies, we passe too many times with it instead of healing them... I think, for now it's my only problem ! =)   I'm still checking a bit though and open to any suggestion or managing ideas other players may have ! ^^

DrnknElf,"Sep 01 2022, ","
					Most of the comments I would write here have already been covered by quite a few people already so I won't get into all of them. But I definitely have some serious issues with the changes.,
,
The rather large induction nerf is terrible. On live I have a 0.5 sec induction for Bolster Courage. On BR the lowest I've been able to get it is 0.9 sec. That's an almost 100% increase in the time needed to fire off that skill and it's the same problem for any other healing induction skill. That is a direct and huge nerf to healing ability and there's nothing at all to offset it.,
,
The 20 second (after traits) global cooldown on anthems makes them half useless. As a main healer I do not have the time to sit there and spam anthems on a timer like that. Making that worse is the choice to either forego using the coda or waste a lot of time building ballads back up in order to keep anthems going. In an intense fight there is literally no way to keep all anthems up and continue to heal properly. That is exacerbated by the increased induction times on all induction heals which lower healing output. Add into that the inability to use the coda anywhere near as much and healing output is lowered yet again.,
,
The nerf to Cry of the Chorus is another problem. I didn't personally hit it as soon as it came off cooldown but used it more for emergency situations and the ability to keep healing while using the coda for its own benefits. It's no longer on a short enough cooldown to be able to do that. It will also cause issues in situations where the silence removal part of the skill is needed. Do I now use the skill even less than before because I absolutely must save it for specific emergency situations?,
,
Call to Greatness is effectively useless. Before it was a very good skill which needed some tweaks to make it useful for all classes. Now it's a 7 minute cooldown of uselessnes. The extremely long cooldown alone makes it useless but the way it now works makes it even less useful since so many of the skills it effects are already on a much, much shorter cooldown already or have their own issues to being able to use the skill twice in a row such as Oathies. There aren't more than a few classes which get any real benefit from it and even then it's very situational. The removal of many of the useful effects the skill has on current live make it even worse. I don't see any point or have any desire to trait it at all since the points are wasted in all but the most rare cases. ,
,
Song of Aid has long needed a rework. Sadly, what we have instead is another useless or at least half useless skill. It works nothing like before and has a cooldown which is way too long to be of any real use outside of rare circumstances. That skill needed to be something other than a channeled skill and needed its effects updated like Call to Greatness and it would have been fine. It's another skill I likely won't trait because it's not worth the points and way too situational since the only useful thing about it is the damage reduction which is too short and/or too weak to be worth it with the long cooldown.,
,
Overall, the changes, especially the anthem changes in practice are clunky and detrimental to the class. Anthems are useless in landscape play. In group play anthems require too much time and effort to be taken away from either healing or dps, whichever the minstrel is doing at the time. They were mostly a set it and forget it thing which was fine since minstrels already had enough to do otherwise. It's now as far from that as possible and in a time wasting and tedious way. The changes to anthems makes the class a lot less fun to play and at the end of the day I'm here to have fun.,
,
Additionally, the way the old anthems and some skills were nerfed in order to make more anthems diluting what minstrels already had is ludicrous. It's not fun and it's not a positive for the class. Just because minstrels now have more skills does not make things better.,
,
I am one of the few who has always like yellow line going back to before trait trees when I would trait four yellow and three blue. I've also like yellow line since the trait trees and always had at least one yellow setup and currently two; one yellow/blue and the other yellow/red. I even like Melody stance from time to time. I've frustrated many a monster player in the moors using that stance years ago and I've used it quite often in tougher landscape content or when soloing instances and even in three mans and some easier six mans. It has its uses. Unfortunately, the changes being made trying to force people into using it because it's stealing benefits we previously used in all stances is a mistake. Nerfing other stances in an attempt to make Melody more desireable is terrible. ,
,
Another issue rises with the desire for the developers to want us to stance dance. It's rare I have time to do any stance dancing in the middle of a group instance unless there's a built in lull. On the landscape its even worse. With the induction reduction changes, it takes longer to change stances than before. There's also the large problem of the five second cooldown before you can change back into the previous stance. That right there makes the stance dancing envisioned with some of these changes impossible and it's an issue that has been around for a long time. Stances either need no cooldown when changing them or at least a large reduction and/or the induction for changing stances needs to be eliminated. Personally, I'd leave the induction on the stance change but remove the cooldown although I'd be perfectly fine with removing both the induction and the cooldown. Stance dancing can be useful and has the potential to be more useful but it's impossible in the current state.,
,
While I've always like yellow, in theory I have no problem with yellow line buffing the other trait lines. If done properly it's a very good change and a great benefit. Trait trees should always have been about buffing skills and such which you already had instead of being a way to add in artificial limits to classes. Anthems should all be in yellow line so any line can benefit from them. Yellow line should be about buffing skills you already have and it's not terrible to have some skills which are only in that line. However, the way the tree is setup with other changes made to the class has made this attempt a failure since the minstrel is actually a worse healer and a worse buffer overall than before. The promise is there but the current execution falls flat on its face.,
,
While I decried how anthems and some skills have been diluted in order to add more anthems, not all of it is bad. It's not bad that the -incoming damage was removed from Inspire Fellows and moved to an anthem since the anthem would spread the effects raid wide and over a larger radius instead of being fellowship only. However, the long global cooldown for anthems makes this change much less useful.,
,
Overall the changes being made to the minstrel are a large net negative. Less healing, more aggravation and more steps to accomplish the same things. I'll repeat that the theory of using yellow line to buff red and blue lines and opening up more anthems and skills to red and blue line is great. But the execution and other changes are simply terrible. ,
,
As it stands the changes, if they go to live, will be a huge mistake. The negatives the changes have created are a severe detriment to the class, its usefulness and its primary roles. Even if the positives somehow made up for the net healing ability they still would be a mistake to take live. The minstrel currently on Bullroarer is nowhere near as capable or fun to play as that on live.

					it is completely unnecessary and superfluous to change anything about the minstrel. you are wasting unnecessary resources here. rather spend your energy on solving the real problems in the game. I like the mechanics of the minstrel the way it is. I looked at the Minstrel updates yesterday on the test server. I do not like it. nobody needs that.

Elaelin,"Sep 01 2022, ","
					Based on what I can tell the plan is to push the mini out of being a main healer and into a support class similar to an LM.  It appears in order to use the anthems effectively the mini will have to be in melody stance or constantly switching to and from the stance.  If this is actually the plan, why not rework the anthems so that they provide an effective and ongoing benefit to the group in terms of buffs and the ability to debuff a boss?  The proposed anthems and shared cool down for anthems makes them cumbersome to use in group content and somewhat useless in solo content since you have to be in combat to begin the process of tiering them up and you have to stay alive and in combat long enough to maximize their use.   Every time combat ends you start over and the mini and group lose the benefits.  Most of the anthems will end up not being used due to time it takes to tier up the anthems and cash them out.  I imagine, most of us will tier up 1, maybe 2 anthems at most and let the rest sit.  The anthems won't be used much on landscape and solo content.  ,
,
You could also consider just making all of the anthems one time big skills that make a difference sort of like when fellowship maneuvers were used.  In a situation like that, the long and shared anthem cool downs would make sense.  The shared cool downs could even be longer depending on how much impact the skill gives to the group.  I would equate that type of anthem to individual call to greatness skills that affect the entire group.  The mini would have the ability to use a skill and make a difference when it counts.  It could be a big dps boost, a boss debuff, a group buff or even a heal buff.   This would make the anthems special and meaningful in a group and not take away from the healing role of the mini.,
,
Call to greatness should live up to its name.  A reset of a CD once every 7 minutes seems not worth spending the points.  The chances for call to greatness to make a major difference in a group are minimal when all it does is reset a CD.  A skill that can only be used once in that long time a time period should offer something epic for the group.  Maybe a massive dps boost or a massive damage reduction or something along those lines.  It should be a skill that makes an actual difference during the boss fight.  Give call to greatness a benefit that matches the name of the skill, something great.,
,
Whatever is decided here, please leave blue and red line as they currently stand.  Please don't ruin piercing cry and force us to always be in melody stance.  I love playing my yellow line mini (I actually have two separate yellow lines that I use.) but there is a time and place for yellow line and there are times when red and blue line are more appropriate to the situation.  Both red and blue lines are in a good place right now.  None of these proposed changes will get a mini a DPS spot in a raid or instance and how many support classes will be used in a group once you fill it with healers, tanks and dps.  Changing the purpose of the mini to support rather than main heals this late in the game does not make sense to me at least.  It would make more sense to just make another LM type class and let the mini continue to be a healer.  The current proposed changes are going to make melody the go to stance and force the mini into one play style with few options and variations.   There will be melody stance for dps on landscape and melody stance for healing/buffing in instances and very little else to choose.  There will be a standard skill rotation of refreshing whatever anthems are in vogue this cycle every 25 second with little if any opportunity for variety.  I suspect the mini will become an extremely boring class to play with limited opportunities to join in group content as the LM and burg will provide better support benefits than the mini.,
,
And while we are discussing completely changing the mini and their place in Middle Earth, please give us the same cool down on the in combat rez skill no matter the line being used.  If the mini is going to become a several times removed cousin to the LM at least give us the same cool down in blue/red line for our rez.   Also, make song of distraction work on chained mobs.  There are so few places where that skill is even worth it anymore.  It would be nice to see it become useful again.

,It is not the case I'm sure. Every heal is still there, we even got more heals. Lost some induction. but it hardly matters. As for the anthems, I do not like the new iteration and would like to see anthems more like auras. Trying to keep several anthems up is not fun at all. But in the end, noone is really forcing us to do so. I already see the way I'll play the mini: most times in Melody, switching to Resonace only if there are constant spikes on the tank, keeping a couple of anthems running, and inserting damage spells between heals.,

I really like the new changes, giving more dps to a healer is always great.

					At the core, I am not against some changes and tweaks to Yellow.,
Personally, I believe a few tweaks and some fine tuning here and there might have been enough, since after all, Minis are in a good place in so far as group content is concerned. We don't need more spots.,
Still, some changes to Yellow might be a good thing. More choices and options is always good for players.,
,
,
I don't think that the solution to Yellow being underplayed is to completely remove it and work it into Blue and Red. Doesn't make sense.,
,
,
What I do find it deplorable is to change Blue and Red playstyle, a style that has been around for many years and, a style that players were happy with. I don't think changing the flow to Mini's gameplay is a good idea at this point.,
And if the justification for it is due to the changes to Yellow line, then that really doesn't make any sense.,
,
,
,
It's not the nerfs per se (although, again, it's surprising that to change Yellow, you needed to nerf Blue and Red). Numbers can be tweaked.,
The issue is the unnecessary and unwanted changes to Blue and Red.,
,
,
They weren't asked for. The number of Minis playing the game is healthy. Meaning that players were overall content in playing minis.,
But this....you're trying to give with one hand while simultaniously taking with your other hand...and feet.,
,
,
,
Think about this: in order to force us to accept your changes to Yellow, you're forcing players to choke on your changes to Blue and Red.,
That doesn't seem wise, at all.,
Before starting this endeavour, did you really think that Minis wanted or even asked a change to their core gameplay loop 10 or more years into the game?,
,
,
,
If you want to improve Yellow line, go ahead. But please, don't take away the essence what made Blue and Red Minis what they were.,
That is the issue. Change yellow, a lot or a few but don't touch Blue and Red. ,
They weren't the problem.,
,
,
You strike me as a good intentioned Developer but one that misread what players enjoy while playing Minis and miscalculated what makes a Mini player tick.,
I hope you consider halting this needless change for the worse and change your angle of attack.,
,
,
In the end though, it's sad to give feedback to SSG, fully knowing SSG doesn't change a comma to any changes once they hit BR but.....players are doing their part at least.,
I respectfully hope you stop this unwanted change and go back to the drawing board.

,
,I agree on the anthems but I really don't want to spend all of my time in melody stance which under the proposed changes will be the only viable option to be effective.  Why have stances at that point?  ,
,
In some ways this almost feels like playing an old school blue cappy.  Buffs and back up heals with a bit of dps on the side.  Very little variety.  It will be an OK design, but it won't be exciting and won't be in high demand as there are other classes that do the same things, only better.  This change is good for those that never played yellow line and stuck to red/blue line.  ,
,
I guess the good thing here is that minis will need less variety in their legendary weapons and that will be less of a grind to maintain.  There won't be a need for a red/yellow/blue set after these changes.  The new Middle Earth buff bots don't need much variety.

Arabani,"Sep 01 2022, ","
					,
,
,You focus too much on buffing, which is not really the role and the main feature of the class. Minstrel is a healer and he will remain so (though I hope Red will actually become a real dps line one day). Anthems are meant to be sutuational short-time cooldowns that can help you and your group or raid, they are not meant to be maintained all the time and all at once.  As I've said, most likely there will be 2-3 up at a time. For instance, there is absolutely no need to cast protective anthems if the incoming damage is manageble. The same is true for cash out effects.,
,
Do not panic and test the changes yourself. They are great. Mostly.

,
,Thanks for the advice.  I tried the changes and was underwhelmed.  Only having one character at level cap and having played the one class since the game started, this will put a damper on my lotro time.  Melody stance and repeating the same couple of anthems every 25 seconds is not my idea of fun.  Just me.  The heals on the test server are less than live and have a longer induction.  We lose heal bonuses with the changes.  The anthems on the test server are not as user friendly or useful as the anthems we have now on live.  They are a lesser quality and require more time and effort to be useful. If I am healing, I don't really need mediocre DPS added.  I doubt most healing minis will have spare time in a difficult instance to DPS in between heals and working on anthems but I am probably just slow on the keyboard.  Yellow line today is great buffs and mediocre heals and dps.  The new system will be mediocre buffs, heals and dps and staying parked in melody stance or constantly swapping from what I saw.  I prefer the variety I currently have with three actual line choices and three stances within each line.  Yes, the changes will be manageable and probably less work as there is no creativity or variety involved with the new set up.   Yellow line did need some love and attention.  Allowing yellow to be a spare set of skills available could have been an outstanding idea and could have worked well.  Blue and red line did not need to be broken to force people to melody stance.  If they would leave blue and red line as is and shorten the CD on anthems I really wouldn't care about this change but in an effort to make melody look more appealing they decided to break blue and red and force us to melody.,
,
I will probably let the mini sit for a couple of months or so after this goes live as I don't see a need to respec and redo weapons for now.  It is not like we have new end game content to worry about anyway.  ,  Let them work out the bugs and problems for a few months and figure out which skills are actually going to be useful in a live server.  And as I said before  I will no longer need three weapon sets with these changes.  I anticipate going to one set with maybe a spare item that focuses on either heals or dps.  Less grind in the new weapon system is a positive change here.

infinitewhimsy,"Sep 01 2022, ","

,
,I would say the Ballad damage bonus from Melody and the AoE from the Coda both give totally negligible amounts of DPS. Just what kind of content are you doing that has a low healing requirement which allows you the time to use these things instead of healing and simultaneously meaningfully benefits from their miniscule added damage? Or are you referring to something else? Because as is I really have no clue what these tools you speak of are,
,
Also the difference in healing is quite big imo because in Melody you lose out on a constant 5% Incoming Healing buff on your entire group granted by Coda of Resonance which you can easily keep up permanently with no time loss due to CotC (comparatively, the bonus from Coda of Melody is a useless 2.5% Partial BPE buff, a complete joke), on top of a 5% Outgoing Healing modifier just from the stances, on top of 10% more damage on your tank during high burst moments since you now lack Improved Coda of Resonance. So not only do you heal for less, your group actually takes less healing, and your tank takes more damage in Melody over Resonance. Maybe in raids I guess Coda of Melody hits more targets and gives you more HPS in that moment, but that's pretty heavily outweighed by the aforementioned I'd say, hell it's probably outweighed just by the few times you have to hit Major Ballad and the fact it AoE heals in Resonance but not Melody.,
,
Put it this way, if Melody wasn't useless, would they be trying to shoehorn us so hard into using it by taking away essential functionality like the crit from Piercing Cry and then putting it back exclusively in Melody stance?

,Several of the changes have actually reduced Red-line damage. Here is how you currently maximize Minstrel DPS:,
,
- 100% uptime on Anthem of War and Anthem of the Third Age.,
- 100% uptime on 3 Minor Ballad buffs.,
- 100% or close uptime on Coda of Fury buff. ,
- Longest possible Anthem duration + refreshing them out of combat / on the run to next target.,
- Most importantly, shortest possible Cry of the Chorus cooldown and using CoftC on CD. ,
,
Your changes broke the whole package. The lowest CoftC CD is now 57s vs 27s so the uptime on its 12% damage buff has been halved. By extension it also halves the uptime of the Coda buff because the Coda is only cast when the fight is about to end or right before CoftC comes off CD. With Encore being -30% only, we simply cannot risk losing the Ballad buffs without the ability to quickly get them back. ,
,
100% uptime on the two Anthems is no longer possible. 100% uptime on the Ballad buffs still is, but is harder to achieve. If you drop out of combat and lose the stacks, and CoftC is on CD, you have to spend 3 GCDs playing the ballads. Yes, unlike the Major ballad in Blue, Minor in Red isn't terrible. However, if you have a higher-damage skill available e.g. Piercing Cry or Call to Fate, but have to play the Ballad, the result is still a DPS net loss.,
,
I doubt your 3% buff to Of All Trades will make up for all this. I realize of course that Minstrel DPS is mediocre and min-maxing it seems like a futile endeavour. Stuff dies fast on landscape regardless and we are not wanted in groups as DPS etc etc.,
,
The fact remains that you're not just gutting heals in Blue, you're nerfing DPS in Red as well. For Minstrels who dream about Red ever becoming a viable group DPS spec, the changes are disappointing to say the least.,
,
P.S. The new shared Anthem CD makes for a very neurotic experience. One has to carefully watch the CD and cast the next Anthem as soon as its ends. If I am late by just a few seconds, the grand total of Anthems I can maintain is reduced. Oh, and when the last NPC in a pull is about to die, but I still have several seconds on my Anthem CD left, should I yell at my group to stop attacking and prolong the fight?

					1. I like spacing out hymns. Just refreshing all hymns felt really bad.,
,
The problem: Now you have to hit a non-heal skill every 20 seconds. Additionally the hymn buffs are really random (power over time? you are buffing fate for the whole raid already),
,
Tie the hymn effect to your active stance, no matter what hymn you get the same bonus.,
     - Healing: Next bolster courage is instant + 100% crit + crit magnitude (or some similar healing bonus),
     - Dmg: Critchance + Critdmg on your Coda? (I dont know anything about dps mini),
     - Melody: 3 Instant Heralds Strike + Improved healing on Heralds Strike,
,
Makes hitting a hymn feel worthwile and you gives you the chance to catch up on healing/dps afterwards. This way you are more likely to keep up hymns even in tight raid situations.,
,
2. Emergency healing,
,
The problem: Removing the reset chance in blue line and upping cd of Cry of the Chorus means one of your key emergency skills is up way less.,
,
In line with the first points make one of the yellow traits give the following benefit:,
Hymns reduce the cd of Cry of the Chorus by 15 seconds.,
,
3. Melody - Stances in general,
,
Problem: Mini go heal, Mini go damage. Buffing was always a side effect -> 2 stances are viable.,
,
At the moment you are trying to improve melody by dragging down the other 2 stances. Surprising enough people dont like that.,
,
Make melody an actual buff focused stance, otherwise one stance will always outdo the other in healing/dps utility and make it obsolete. Keep healing and dps in the other 2 stances.,
,
To archieve true healing-dps-buff disticntion between stances I suggest heavily altering most skill depending on active stance.,
,
Crazy take: Alternatively remove Melody, you were not able to make a whole buff-focused traitline viable and straight up removed it. Why go out of your way and waste time and effort just to fail again, on stances this time?

BOB9,"Sep 01 2022, ","
					Just wanted to offer my perspective as someone who is not particularly attached to mini's playstyle, but picked up a pocket yellow/red mini for high tier raiding purposes.,
,
1. The current changes have no macro changes on how dps or dps support minis are or will be used for raids.,
,
2. DPS minis will still be tied to the dps hunter meta, because of the call of orome light mit debuff and now the new call to greatness. They will be replaced when the debuff is no longer worth carrying along and hunters will switch to fire oil. ,
,
3. Red minstrel does roughly the same dps in dissonance or melody stance in beta, because of the light mit debuff stacking. So dissonance is useless for endgame raids.,
,
4. To make red minstrel a competitive raid dps you need to rework light mit debuffs or else they will become early 130 lightning RK again.,
,
5. If you want red minstrel to be a support dps ala captain they need strong buffs unique to red that are not available in blue and are relevant to more than just hunters.,
,
There are a few good changes:,
,
1. Being able to use call to fate in melody stance. Giving  melody another dps skill to hit is a much welcomed change. ,
,
2. Nerfing Piercing Cry. Disagree with everyone’s feedback about the piercing cry change. It’s a great decision. It was ridiculous that one of your mainstay spammable dps skills was everything all at once. Having to swap to melody is annoying, but melody is better than dissonance for dps anyway right now so…lol. Also blue minis in resonance do not need piercing cry the way it is on live.,
,
Overall I am disliking these changes. Blue minstrel heals are nerfed and the feedback I’ve heard from my group is that it is dumbed down, slower, less engaging and not fun to play. Rotating anthems is not fun or engaging gameplay regardless of the line you are doing it in. Removing the yellow traitline just makes the water murky for what the vision of dps mini is supposed to be. If it’s supposed to be a main dps class then their dps is well shy of the mark. If it’s supposed to be similar to red captain it’s again well shy of the mark. There needs to be many more rounds of testing before this goes live as it is very unpolished and lacks a clearly defined goal for the class.,
,
,
A few questions for OnnMacMahal:,
,
1. What is the purpose of these changes and what is the goal?,
,
2. What role/roles should Red and Blue minstrel be performing in raids and what classes/specs are they competing against for spots in future raids?,
,
,
Here are the changes that I would make.,
,
1. Make melody stance the middle ground between resonance and dissonance stance. A support/dps or support/heal spec depending on if you are blue or red. (This is the same as Yellow/Red mini and Yellow/Blue mini on live, so I understand wanting to move away from this),
2. Make red mini’s in dissonance a strong, but solo oriented dps spec. Ideally they would be a main dps, but I don’t think there are enough resources for this,
3. Keep Blue mini in resonance a strong healer. On beta they are nerfed roughly 25%,
4. Make all ballads fast skills, this smooths out rotation for both Blue and Red.,
5. Reduce the base inductions of minstrel heals, right now they are overly reliant on -% induction buffs and nerfing those doesn’t solve the core issue.,
6. Increase Red mini dps significantly. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to start with a 30% base dps increase for all ballads, codas and crys. Right now the numbers are atrocious in both melody and dissonance stance.,
7. Make Anthems actually a decision. Right now on beta anyone not rotating and tracking anthems is trolling their group. It’s bad gameplay and game design,
8. Reduce the number of anthems to 2 or 3 and only allow one active at a time. One dps boost, one for incoming heals to burst up a target, and one for survivability.

,This is a serious worry for me and why I dislike the Orome changes so much, what kind of joke is it that you do more damage in the stance with less sacrifices/specializing for the sake of DPS? That has historically been the class identity of War-Speech/Dissonance, you give up healing so you can do damage, now you do both in Melody on top of stealing the stun and corruption removal. ,
,
I mean ask yourselves, what does Dissonance really have that Melody doesn't? A pittance more Ballad damage? Damage from the Thunderous Codas effect? That probably doesn't outweigh the better mitigation debuff for yourself, let alone for your entire group. This design is atrocious and ""Anti-Minstrel"", it makes the class feel like some generic MMO caster with no thematic weight or identity. Dissonance needs to do significantly more damage than Melody to have a reason to exist. ,
,
Melody of course...has no reason to exist...imo you should get rid of it as a stance entirely and instead make it a temporary buff effect that modifies how skills function, a  bit how Codas used to be. Maybe then it'd feel like an impactful decision, but the current effects limited to it aren't at all what I'd pick or focus on. I'll reiterate that Herlad's Hammer and its variants is useless 99% of the time without the Hiddenhoard 4 set effect. I'll also reiterate that Resonant Piercing Cry does little to nothing and Coda doesn't do more damage or healing than most of our other skills despite being a cash out that requires 3 Ballads...so touting these skills as the key differences between stances is laughable.

					First off, let me say thank you so much for your time and your feedback. I know changes like these can be frustrating, but I really do appreciate all of you taking the time to read through the changes, hop into Bullroarer, and write out your feeling and feedback here.,
,
While I can’t address everything that’s been said here, I’m going to do my best to respond to some of the most common comments.,
,
,
Let’s start off with Piercing Cry. While Piercing Cry is a delightful and iconic part of the minstrel’s toolkit, the base effects of this skill were simply overloaded. Keep in mind, this is a skill with a 10s cooldown, and that cooldown can be reset as frequently as every 1 or 2 seconds. For a skill that a red-line minstrel will often be using between every other skill, it was simply doing too much. It’s immediate, so it cancels animations from other skills. It’s an interrupt, so it will cancel monster inductions the second they start. It cleansed corruptions, making it nearly impossible for a monster to build any corruption buffs. And it stunned, for a whopping 5 seconds on criticals, which happen most of the time due to the +30% crit chance trait. That’s all on top of it putting out huge damage! Interrupting, stunning, clearing corruptions, and being the backbone of a red minstrel’s DPS rotation is simply too much for a skill you’re using that frequently.,
,
While some of you have expressed great concern over losing this stun in sol/landscape environments, you recently gained the ability to stun mobs in an AoE by traiting a few points into ‘Enduring Morale’ in the red line. This is both a more reliable stun than Piercing Cry, and happens to be AoE, with only a 30s cooldown.,
,
If you really must have the Piercing Cry stun and corruption removal, they are still there for you in Melody stance. Melody, in general, should have a stronger identity as a stance which gives you greater group-support utility.,
,
,
,
So lets talk about Melody! Before these changes, there wasn’t much reason to be in Melody stance. It put out worse healing and worse damage than Dissonance and Resonance, respectively, without bringing any additional utility to the table. Want to debuff monsters? Dissonance did it better. Want to buff your group? Resonance did it better. While Melody technically allowed you to heal some and DPS some, it didn’t make you particularly good at either one. In the future, Melody should be an appealing stance for group support and utility, while still leaving Resonance and Dissonance as stronger choices when you’re simply trying to maximize your personal Healing or Damage output. ,
,
,
Along with the changes to Melody, yes, the Call of Oromë debuff has been reduced. Like Piercing Cry, this was frankly too powerful. Call of Oromë is a single, long-range, AoE skill on a short cooldown. The fact that it essentially removed all light mitigation from a monster (or raid boss) was simply too powerful for one button press. And while it made bringing a Y/R minstrel more appealing for the current raid, that has more to do with the raid design and the relative strength of hunters than it has to do with the Minstrel class being able to shine. We’d prefer if DPS minstrels were appealing for their ability to debuff, buff, and DPS as a complete package, rather than for the value of a single debuff.,
On that same note, however, minstrels in Dissonance stance will still reduce light mitigation when they use Call of Oromë, and that debuff stacks with itself twice. While the debuff is stronger in Melody, you will still get a non-trivial boost out of using this debuff, whether you’re in Dissonance focused on your personal DPS, or in Melody focusing a bit more on group utility.,
,
,
,
I understand that the changes to Induction modifiers are frustrating, but this is not a nerf directed at Minstrels. The fact is, for characters at various level ranges, it’s trivially easy to achieve -100% induction speed under certain conditions. With these changes, -Induction bonuses you gain from traits and traceries will still help you shorten your inductions, but will now be multiplied with your ‘-All Skill Inductions’ buffs from skills or gear. ,
I’m also taking a look at possibly reducing baseline Minstrel inductions slightly. The goal is not to make Healing feel slow or clunky; it’s simply to make it such that you can’t build your Minstrel in a way that allows you to ignore all inductions completely!,
,
,
, (Watcher of Resolve Trait),
I know some of you are upset to see this trait go, but it simply wasn’t performing very well. It had an internal cooldown of 30s, which was necessary due to the power of resetting Cry of the Chorus. But in practice, the fact that it proc’d off of any heal skill meant it usually triggered the reset as soon as its 30s internal cooldown expired. In conjunction with the fact that Cry of the Chorus has its own cooldown, that meant you often triggered the ‘Inspiring Cries and Calls’ reset when Cry of the Chorus was a few seconds away from being off-cooldown anyway. ,
Additionally, several of you have expressed frustration at losing the ability to frequently chain Coda of Resonance and Cry of the Chorus to maintain 100% uptime on ballad buffs, without ever using Major Ballad. It makes sense; I do it myself when healing as a blue-line minstrel, but I’d rather work to make Ballads a more functional part of the rotation than continue to design around relying on Cry of the Chorus to circumvent the ballad building & cashout system entirely. Keep in mind, Major Ballad can now target an ally, so it can be used to heal your tank, and it still applies a splash heal around your target. As of the next Bullroarer, all Ballad skills will also be ‘Fast’ which should help make them feel more like part of your rotation, and less like they’re gumming it up.,
,
,
,
Just to clarify, we’re not out to ‘delete all yellow lines’ or cut all classes down to two specializations. We wanted to convert the yellow minstrel trait tree into a non-specialization tree because there was so much to love about the yellow line, but so little incentive to fully commit to it, due to the ways it penalized your base Healing or Damage output.,
,
,
I’ll do my best to respond to the feedback on anthems soon, but for now, I’m out of time from writing this already-lengthy post!,
,
,
And lastly, I do want to say again that I truly appreciate all of your feedback, and look forward to the next round of Bullroarer!

,Thank you for your response. I don't really agree with all of your rationales behind the changes, but I can't really argue with results. At least for Warrior-Skald. They make sense and I do seem to be hitting harder on BR than I was on live. That being said, I do think you need to iterate on these changes some more. ,
,
What I really wanted to hear about was the one thing you ran out of time to talk about. Anthems. I really want to hear your reasoning behind this and what methods you expect us to employ for them. Because as it stand now, it just feels clunky. So if there's something I'm missing or a new technique that I should be learning, please elucidate.

,
,Hopefully when they come with the next Bullroarer and make them Fast, it might feel a little better. I've always felt weird with how the current minstrel anthems work. It seemed like a minstrel should use three ballads against the enemy and then use an anthem, then repeat. But what we normally do is sit there, use our cry, cast all of our anthems, and then go in charging. We did it because it was effective. I'm not saying it was wrong, but I always wondered if there was another way to look at the traditional approach to how songs would be built in battle.
				"
Elaelin,"Sep 02 2022, ","
					Here is my question for SSG.  You are changing the mini because you want melody stance to be more important than it is today.  Every class in the game has something that makes it stand out in a crowd.  Every class has a ""super power.""  For example:  the RK has the best heal over time and is outstanding at DPS, the cappy has the best damage buffs and makes an outstanding tank and is able to heal and rez while accomplishing all those tasks, the bear has the best raid wide heals, the hunter is the best dps in game, the LM is absolutely needed to debuff bosses. the champion can clear entire hallways in one pull and so on.  Currently, a blue line mini has the best single target heals in game and a yellow mini is great for group buffs in a raid setting. ,
,
After these changes are implemented, what is going to make the mini stand out in a crowd?  It won't be DPS because you are not making any significant increases to mini dps.  It won't be the buffs because the new anthem choices are not that exciting and require too much tiering up over an extended period of time that a group would probably not consider replacing an LM or a cappy with a mini to buff the group.  A raid may take a mini for buffs but I don't anticipate a mini being first choice to buff in a fellowship setting and for raids it will probably be for niche situations only.  There are only so many support spots in a raid and even fewer in a fellowship.  It probably won't be heals because they are being reduced significantly.   Based on what I can see from these changes, the mini will not be a go to class for any type of group content or role.  The mini will have nothing unique or special to offer a group.  The mini will be equal to and in many cases less than their counterparts for the same roles in a group setting.,
,
What skills in these changes will make the mini a first string useful and welcome member of a fellowship or a raid?  What will make melody stance a ""must have"" skill in a fellowship or a raid?  What will be the mini's super power when all the dust settles?  Is the intention to make the mini a ""bench"" or ""backup"" class?  What will be the mini's role in group content and what will make them a competitive class for group content?

,
,What about Dissonance's identity? Why would you ever use Dissonance now? With the superior Orome debuff and the DPS numbers being so marginally different, you are better off in Melody on top of being able to heal and CC and remove corruptions and stun. Again, if you stack 2 Orome's, you're probably doing more damage in Melody than in Dissonance because of the debuff. So what about Dissonance's identity? ,
,
It feels truly strange to hear you basically say Piercing Cry is overpowered...when it was the half the reason Minstrel DPS was remotely tolerable (the other is the Orome debuff, which you've also nerfed)...and Minstrel DPS was totally unacceptable and not welcome in any real groups for any real content despite this. So what was so OP about Piercing Cry really? Killing landscape mobs? As another poster pointed out, the only time it marginalized mechanics and was overpowered was for corruption removal in raids, which you can still do in Melody. So how can you claim you're correcting Piercing Cry's viability?,
,
Minstrel as a DPS class is not used in raids, at all. So...yeah...,
,
To be clear - - by reducing the Orome debuff you are reducing Piercing Cry Damage too, so it's not actually even more damaging in Dissonance which gets less than half the Orome debuff Melody does, which is of course 1/3rd of what it is on live. So, on top of losing all of its utility, the skill probably doesn't hit harder in the DPS stance, which of course you sacrifice utility AND healing to use. I'd call that a disaster of design, wouldn't you? ,
,
Bullroarer is down currently, but when I looked it seemed almost unthinkable for Minstrels to trait Enduring Morale in anything but red specialization, just fyi. Other traits take priority, so that feels like a big copout answer. And that's sidestepping the fact CotSA can't possibly replace PC since it is very short range, part of your usual rotation and likely on cd, and not easily resettable (it's actually harder to reset now since you increased the CD on Anthem of the Third Age AND because you want to keep Anthems on CD permanently). Also worth pointing out you're not just removing Piercing Cry's stun from Dissonance, you're removing it from everything except Melody. I constantly used it to stun in Resonance and even reset it to keep doing so since it was responsive and snappy I could support my group quickly without a loss in heals. Can't do that anymore, not without wasting time swapping stances. And it's worth mentioning you've also removed the Reflect component which had up to 100% uptime and added it to Song of Aid every few minutes for a few seconds instead. This slight of hand with the changes where you shuffle the toolkit doesn't ever seem to end with us coming out ahead. ,
,
,
,
,You failed to address the fact you ALSO increased the cooldown of CotC as well as removed the reset. How can you say this trait should go because it resets CotC about the time it is seconds away from resetting (which I don't even agree is true) when you also doubled the effective cooldown of CotC thereby warranting the trait you just discounted because the cooldown was too short but is now longer?,
,
It doesn't matter if Major Ballad is fast or targettable now, the numerical heal is the same, it's a bad skill, you don't want to use it. These are band aids, they don't change the reality. Why would you want to use Major Ballad instead of SoS? The latter not only heals for more, but gives a mitigation buff and sorely lacking damage buffering via a stackable HoT. Arguably the ONLY time you'd use Major Ballad instead of SoS is to reset Piercing Cry, which you can only do in Melody now, and Melody Stance changes Major Ballad to in fact not heal at all but give a worthless amount of damage or maybe a worthless debuff too if you trait for it (a trait which is only good for Minor Ballad, which you should never use while healing). These rationalizations are truly strange, and anything but convincing. ,
,
Also keep in mind, by changing this you've also removed the Minstrel's ability to reliably keep up the 5% Incoming Healing buff on the group through your Coda (which of course you now need to spend 5 trait points on BR for the same effect you have on live by default).  But you see now you NEVER want to Coda except once a minute when CotC is up, you've removed nuance, not added it. This also affects Improved Coda of Resonance, which is now no longer desirable either.,
,
This response has left me feeling disappointed and discouraged. I mean it's great of you to restate the concerns everyone has posted, but you haven't actually answered them. Giving reasons for why you did what you did isn't the same thing as answering or acknowledging the reasons Minstrel players don't want these changes, it's not really any kind of discourse at all more like an evasion or digression.,
,
I understand that it's easier to just keep the current system and switch around a few skill categories, but it's not a good system. For example, Coda is a cash out like you said, but how much does it do? The only reason people care about Coda is because it removes your Ballad buffs and prevents you from using Anthems. The actual heal or damage is not impressive, it's not much more than our other skills (sometimes it's less) and it doesn't feel impactful.  Imagine that, hitting 4 buttons, 4 global cooldowns, and it does less than hitting 1. That's a terrible 'cash out'.,
,
Trying to force players to Coda and Ballad more without new or interesting reasons to do so WHILE ALSO increasing inductions is anti-fun incarnate, especially when you're already adding a higher GCD (global cool down) cost to playing Minstrel with these in combat shared CD Anthems, it's clunky and NOT fun. There's no nuance to automatically hitting the next Anthem every time the skill lights up as off CD. Some other angle is clearly desirable if you bother to look at the system. I mean look at Perfect Ballad. It gives Power Reduction. POWER REDUCTION. It's pure trash, has no use anywhere at any time, ever and lots of players don't even put it on their quickbars, and yet you're going to keep it...maybe switch it to Fast along with Major Ballad. In this thread I've listed quite a few skills and buffs and traits, old and new, that are completely negligible, I didn't see you mention any of them. Yeah, discouraged is the word.,
,
,
I'll let other people talk about the loss of induction speed, because honestly what's the point, these BR feedback threads always go the same way. It's kind of funny because I was just complaining it's always 1 step forward and 2 steps back with SSG the indian givers, and I just finished getting my 2 induction Word of Craft Focus traceries after maxing the reward track and grinding out boxes, and now pretty much that exact number is being removed from the class. I guess it must be nice in RK land, where you not only keep your induction reduction, but now you'll benefit from the Minstrel's Anthem of the Third Age while the Minstrel doesn't. Must be damn nice.

					Mac, you spoke like a politician: you said a lot, but didn't back anything up.,

Make our lives more difficult? Well, mission accomplished. ,
,
Second, you claim that you want Melody to be desired and played in a group and solo setting. Why? Are minstrels the ONLY class with an unplayable trait line? Why start with us, while we have 2 great lines for 2 different roles? Why not with Trapper or Shadow Guardian or Tanking Warden or Healing Cap or Tanking Champion? Why break something that is already working, while so many other classes have issues with their MAIN roles, let alone their secondary, or tertiary? ,

,
,Piercing Cry is/was immediate, a corruption removal, an interrupt, a stun, resettable, had a reflect trait, and hit for good damage. It obviously was too much for 1 skill, anything less is just unreasonable. ,
,
Seriously, read that list again, maybe do it two times. This 1 skill is half of our effective toolkit which is why you can't just remove that stuff from our 2 main stances and think everyone will be happy.,
,
The problem is that it had to be that way because our other skills are mediocre. Minstrel never gets taken for DPS for a reason, our DPS was only tolerable because of Orome's debuff and PC reset spam, both of which are heavily nerfed in our DPS stance. Minstrel DPS is probably 2nd to last next to Captain, except Red Captain has a guaranteed place in groups because of Oathbreakers/To Arms/Banner. Red Minstrel has zero place in groups.,
,
 It's fine to change Piercing Cry, it should clearly be changed, but you shouldn't do it without giving us something else in return on our other skills especially  for Dissonance and redline. The change feels like #### because you're removing the one thing that was holding over an otherwise mediocre trait spec. Without Orome and spamming PC red Mins DPS is a joke. And yes you can still spam PC, but why would you ever do it in Dissonance now when you have more than double the light damage debuff in Melody and vastly more utility AND healing unlocked? Dissonance has ceased to make any coherent sense with these changes. It's a DPS stance that doesn't do meaningful damage compared to the utility stance that doesn't sacrifice anything while Dissonance sacrifices a lot.

					It has always been a poor choice to give skills multiple effects. Use it for one thing and loose it for another more important reason or have it unused waiting for something that doesn't occur. ,

This echoes the LI revamp; those who were far from pushing the the limits of the old system are blindsided by an increase in the numbers to acceptance and dragging others down with them. Bashing random skills ignoring skill queue and skill cancelling and you'll like see higher. Why else have official streamers that play minis like this? So n00bs think that's good play and years of over level gaming never instils any need to buff anthems!

					It was a previous dev's cop out that delivered the Piercing Cry OTT functionality and left as is for us to not relish missing it from now on. The parses will ""prove"" the final iteration ofc but will it leave the majority of minis with the choice to just not bother with anthems when they are no longer part and parcel of the solo game and muscle memory on entering raid environments.  Reminds me of the Guard's bleed dynamics when solo, building bleed up when mobs would be long dead with shield use instead, unless pulling a wake of bleeding mobs across the map and back tracking for one hooked up on a rock.

,Honestly, I just want more explanation for how anthems work now. If it's meant that I'm supposed to be more choosey as to which anthem to throw up in any give situation and only run one, perhaps two anthems at a time, fine. I'll have to take a look at it again when BR is back up.,
,
Faster ballads would be a very welcome change. To increase DPS, you're supposed to chain together three Minor Ballads to maximize DPS. But I find myself doing Minor - Major- Perfect simply to get my Coda up faster. It's not great, but I prefer that to Minor - Cry- Minor - Another Cry - Minor - Yet Another Cry. I want to nuke stuff ,as opposed to a few minutes from now. And I know about spamming Cry of the Chorus, but this old dog never could get used to that new trick. It's effective on live, without a doubt, but I'm still rather stuck on using it as an emergency ""I need to tier up NOW"" skill than something that should be in regular rotation. ,
,
As for piercing cry, I still want my stun back. I could care less about the reflect or corruption removal. Corruptions are a joke on landscape and Tier 1 solo instances. With few exceptions, you can freely ignore them as if they weren't on the mob to begin with. You want to fix something, fix that. While I do realize we have the new AOE stun, it's like asking for a scalpel and being handed a hammer. Sometimes I just want to keep that one mob out of the way for a few seconds while I deal with his friends.

,Mediocre equipped mini (including LI, traits, virtues) better stay out of Gundabad now. Swapping stances in the middle of a fight or have longer fights is mostly not an option. There are to many grouped mobs which include signatures and to many patrols that make kiting impossible and even some AoE. We are a light class, especially vulnerable when attacked by groups. It seems clear to me that the dev has not played a red mediocre geared mini on level in Gundabad enemy camps. I also am at this point convinced that these changes to red and blue are made due to PvMP. I hope to get through Gundabad before they go live because my minis will take a long break after. It seems laughable to having got mad/sad about the hunter barrage/focus changes and the LM pet changes when this is completely destroying red mini as is.

,I concur. I haven't raided in years, so my mini had no raid gear to fall back on. The gear you do get as you level up through Gundabad isn't really great. I even tried running a yellow build through there and found I had to be exceedingly careful as to which skills I applied as I could end up pulling more mobs than I could handle with little to no room for kiting. I didn't really feel in a comfortable spot again as a red minstrel until I was able to craft a full set of 140 armor. My jewelry is still a mess, so that's the next thing I'll have to get my jeweler's crafting up for.

Maybe we will get a middle earth version of a druid that uses flower power and plants to heal and buff?  There is a reason this nerf is being fast tracked and supposedly there is a big announcement in September.  Resources are being used to make these major changes to the mini.

the two main things I do not understand:,

- Why changing a class really no player complains about over a few years. The Mini forum is as silent as no other forum. There are no big complaining from RK or beos, or who else can heal or support in a raid. We see a endgame-raidcontent with all three main-healers be part of it. So why this big chance without any player-based reason? (Or do I miss something),
,
,
- The other thing I really do not understand is the arguing with red-traitline, because the last thing a mini had to do is DPS. For me, the identity of mini is healing as the first part and supporting as the second. I can play without a red-traitline much more than without a yellow one. I know, this is not the main opinion, because solo play has always to be easy and not frustrating. But in an MMO I play with friends there is always a way to get trough difficult content outside a raid or instance. If you really want to give melody and yellow a justification for existence, than close the red-line! And give classes like hunters, champions and so one the chance to be the real DDs in the very small spots they have in raids. You can give us a buff for landscape to increase the DPS with a mechanic like 'still as death', so we are not allow to use it in raids or in pvmp

					@OnnMacMahal,
,
Some of us here are end-game content raiders for many years now. We know our stuff. Please listen to our feedback.,
It's easy to spot who are the end-game players and who are not.,
,
,
,
1- ,
,
I would agree with you that Piercing Cry does too much. So do so many other skills in the game. But Red Minis have NO place in group content. Zero. None. Nada. There's Hunters, RKs, Wardens, Brawlers, Burglars and probably LMs before ANYONE would consider taking a Red Mini.,
With that in mind: why? Why are you nerfing a DPS skill on a class that never gets a slot as DPS in group content? Not even the biggest white knights and shills ever said that Red Mini is broken...so...why?,
Red mini is bad as it is without any more nerfs.,
Mind you: Red Mini should NEVER be viable for group content, otherwise Minis would get slots as Healers AND as DPS, so I think most Minis are fine with never getting a DPS slot on instances and raids. Perfectly fine with it.,
,
But nerfing the best and most useful Red Mini skill ...with what intention? Make it even slower to level and more painful? None of us gets it.,
,
,
,
,
2- ,
,
The problem we have with Melody is that you're trying to force us to use Melody by nerfing everything else. Melody isn't better, you just made Ressonance and Dissonance so much worse. That's all there is.,
I would suggest trying to improve Yellow line instead. Moreover, don't delete Yellow, make yellow better ,
,
,
For example, improve the Anthems in while in Yellow/Melody, give them extra stuff but keep Yellow Anthems from being castable during combat (and only yellow or you nerf solo play) to Yellow-->BLue trait dancing pre-combat.,
Remove the silly Block stance and give us more options to support through, well...support. Say, -inc damage, +outgoing healing, +mits to phys/tat, + max morale, + bubbles, + speed, etc etc...,
,
,
But do it without nerfing Blue and Red. Make yellow better, make it desirable.,
Most people here are telling you that.,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Ok, you're not out to delete all yellow lines or cut classes specializations...but that's what you are doing to minstrels. That's exactly what you're doing.,
It doesn't make sense.,
There's so much to love about yellow line...... so you destroy yellow and worse, you destroy the playstyle for Blue that players here happy with for many years.,
,
,
Don't you think you're trying too hard? You're trying to give us something we don't want, while at the same time removing lots of stuff from BLue that we DID want to keep.,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Yes, it's frustrating because on top of all the nerfs and needless changes, you're nerfing our induction speed.,
And it IS directed at Minstrels because we're the only ones getting nerfed.Nobody else is getting this nerf-bat treatment you are giving us. YOu're not helping minis, you're making them worse. Sorry for being honest but it's the truth.,
How are we supposed to believe your words when your actions are doing the opposite?,
,
,
,
,
Last but not the least:,
,
I repeat: Minstrels did not want Yellow to be deleted. Improved yes. Or to be left alone. But this huge overhaul while at the same time destroying the Blue playstyle is a mistake.,
We've been playing this game for many, many years now. We were happy with the state of Minis.,
You are changing minis for the worse, not for the better.,
,
,
,
I hope you can see this and at least, try to convince your bosses that this is not the way. There is a better way to do improve Yellow without this change for the worse. ,
We as players, most of us here high-end raiders, can help you do your job for the better. We can offer some suggestions (no doubt some too OP) and you can shave off the numbers and ideas.,
,
,
,
,
I hope you can take your help and realize that this change is for the worse. A lot worse. ,
If you aim to improve ONE specialization but you end up making all three specs worse and players unhappy....shouldn't the change be placed on hold and reavaluated?

					,
,
,Why not? RKs get spots as both heals and DPS. ,
,
With the way trait trees looked on BR you won't be able to get all of your Anthems with just 1 Minstrel so it's not that bad to bring 2 Minstrels. And even though Call to Greatness is still full of useless resets like Javelin of Deadly Force the CD on the skill is actually much higher than the duration of the debuff that prevents you from using it again, suggesting again that they want multiple Minstrels in the group... I'm not saying that's going to happen mind you, because I doubt anyone cares enough to waste a DPS slot for things like that, but the concept is there.,
,
I'm not fine with our red spec being the only one unwelcome in raids. That's why I liked the way yellow spec used to work, because you kind of sort of got to DPS as Minstrel as long as you kept your Anthems up, but of course that potential is completely gone now since Blue can get up all of the yellow Anthems now, and has better ones than the red line too (compare Anthem of the Third Age Resonance to Dissonance, the latter is significantly worse). ,
,
And of course now red feels worse solo too with either low numbers in Melody or lower Orome debuff and lost utility and slower anthems and...hah...,
,
,
,
,Thanks for reminding me. I completely forgot they nerfed Still as Death cooldown too, as though the skill wasn't disabled 99.9% of the time you wanted to use it anyway. I remember how these things used to work and how incredibly iconic and thematic they were for group play, and it makes me sad to think about it now. No-one has asked or cared about Still as Death for years now when we used it all the time for stuff throughout SoA, Moria, Mirkwood, to skip mobs, to deaggro, to save on repairs, to rez the group without retreating, etc... ,
,
But of course , is now everywhere. So I guess they better nerf the CD so you can't use it on landscape either.,
,
 Definitely going to get a swap LI for distract, if I'm even still playing my Minstrel...or this game.

					The priority here is development of the system dev's skills set. Doesn't matter how badly or well it goes because LinkedIn doesn't require independent citation. You'd want it to go well ofc or might not feel you want to include said reference. Cordovan doesn't include what he does for Lotro for example.,
,
Internal promotions have ever been the means for staff development so roots in QA in general may be seen as a good grounding, just not so much with Lotro's avoidance/denial of issues over the years. ,
,
There is one classic bug that minstrels have had to bare for years when we refresh anthems between fights; using Chord of Salvation to activate anthems and fall foul of the out of combat for 9 seconds mechanic and largely wasting the CoS.  Now if you were unconcerned about starting encounters with anthems up and running you'd not perhaps notice this bug so much. That QA never got this bug addresses over the years would hint at it wasn't being given any priority. Just a thing we had to work around.  It would indicate a reason for the out of touch anthem changes proposed though if you were not providing your group with those buffs. The free LP/MC or wonton key spending gets you those group play slots before those who have to grind out their gains over months ofc. ,

I maybe stretching it but I am struggling to explain it any other way.

					Found some audio for a minstrel keeping up their anthem rotation:,
,
,
Jokes aside please revise how you're setting up anthems. You're right that we don't want to be spamming out anthems before combat, but we also don't really want to be spamming them out during combat either. We'd be better off only being able to have one anthem active on the raid at a time, potentially with the option of changing which anthem is active to suit the situation.,
,
By suit the situation I mean more generic swapping between offence, defence, or utility. Not the kind of anthem setup where only half the DPS are getting boosted because you separated tactical/physical damage into separate anthems or anything like that. That kind of situation is frustrating for those who don't get boosted and kinda just further enforces whatever is the meta.

 Plus that guy is talking about landscape, how many Anthems do you imagine they're going to have up and running on the average pull now that they have a 20s shared CD and are in combat only, so I doubt Prowess even makes it as a consideration. ,

I don't even have any guesses to what you mean by added survivability. Survivability is far lower in red line without the stun from PC.

,Mini landscape damage is very strong now, it has received a massive buff in damage.,

Until you get up to speed you can always quest in high built up areas in blue spec, the main problem with mini is the self-healing is garbage in red spec, i complained about this when our last revamp passed by and we were given god-mode bubbles as a band-aid fix.  They have been reigned in somewhat, but they still haven't done anything to address the poor self-healing in red.,
,
I have a hybrid spec on my main mini that I used to solo instances with, it is blue spec with not a lot in blue, it was mostly a ballad/piercing cry/call of orome spamming build with the added benefit of having SoS, a double strength Chord and Snowball.  Just having that constant stream of SoS healing will make you almost unkillable in landscape, anything that can't kill you very quickly isn't going to be able to.

KaiserThorin,"Sep 04 2022, ","
					Hi guys, I just want to share some thoughts about the anthem system. I really like the idea to make the anthem more special by creating an anthem wide cooldown, forcing the player to choose depending on the situation which anthem to play. But I have to agree with minstrel players, that these changes would demote the current yellow minstrel to a weak support class, not comparable to the captain.,
,
,
With that in mind, I thought about different ways to solve these problems. I came up with a couple of o.k. solutions, tho one really excited me.,
The idea is to create few strong anthems with a clear purpose of strengthen either the offensive, defensive or resilience stats. That could look like the following anthems:,
,
-Anthem of Offensive giving everyone 10% Physical Damage, 20% Tactical Damage and maybe a 5% Attack Duration cut (would be the combined stats from anthem of war, anthem of third age and prowess),
-Anthem of Defensive giving everyone around 150000 Physical Mitigation, 200000 Tactical Mitigation and 2% less incoming damage (a stronger substitute for anthem of composure),
-Anthem of Resilience giving everyone around 400000 Resistance Rating and 15% Incoming Healing, maybe 2% bpe (taking the leftovers from composure and third age to create an anthem for tanks, to heal them up easier),
,
,
The trade off would be, that only one anthem can be active, so the anthem played would overwrite the current anthem. With that, the minstrel player has to make a decision based on the situation to play the best powerfull anthem to buff the group. Especially in a raid, that offers the minstrel player the opportunity to increase the capability of the raid based on the situation. If the raid is trying to challenge T2 with a couple of poorly equiped fellows, the minstrel may decide to play the antehm of defensive to boost their mitigations. Otherwise, when the minstrel is facing a T4 raid, he may alternate between increasing the damage output of the group and increasing the survivability of the tanks. With the upcoming changes to Coda of Melody with a yellow trait, the minstrel would even be able to try a reset on the anthem cooldown for a fast anthem switch.,
Also for the ettenmoors, the anthems would elevate the importance of the player's decision to play the right anthem. Depending on the group's composition, numbers and enemy facing, the minstrel may choose: the offensive anthem for a highly skilled 6man group facing a zerg raid, the anthem of defensive for a raid of low-geared freeps to boost their defensive or the anthem of resilience to substitute the missing loremaster to counter the weaver skills and incoming healing debuffs.,
,
,
With that said, of course the anthems would be very powerfull. So to counter that, those anthems could be designed as improved versions and must be upgraded by putting lots of points into the yellow tree line, forcing you to spend points very thoughtful into the blue tree and red tree. Therefore, the weak version of the anthems could be a part of the minstrel base toolkit and available in every skill tree.,
,
The weak version of the Anthems could look like:,
-Anthem of Offensive 5% Physical and Tactical Damage Increase,
-Anthem of Defensive 50000 Physical Mitigation and 80000 Tactical Mitigation,
-Anthem of Resilience 150000 Resistance Rating and 5% Incoming Healing,
,
For the cash-out effects of the anthems by playing the coda, anthem of offensive could provide 100% crit chance on coda like anthem of war, anthem of defensive a self hot and anthem of resilience a power over time like anthem of composure.,
,
,
Of course I didn't forget about the Anthem of Third Age which is very important to the dps minstrels. I really like the ""Anthem of Third Age: Dissonance"" from the beta and think it should be included into the toolkit. Tho, it might not be a part of the base toolkit and be made available by putting points into the red tree line where the anthem of war is now. (never was a friend of putting points into the red tree to just get anthem of war) With that, Anthem of the Third Age is a part of the red tree skill line.,
,
One question remains, what's with Anthem of Third Age: Resonance?,
This Anthem has always been a very important part of improving the healing output. But with the possible upcoming changes of skill induction reduction and the plenty available options of reducing the skill enduction, maybe the Anthem will loss importance. In my proposed idea, you have to trait into the red line to get the Anthem and even than, the ""anthem of the third age: resonance"" offers less to the group. So it will only be a bail-out anthem to provide a little bit more healing to save the tank, with an instant cast bolster healing. This anthem would surely receive a downgrade.,
,
,
So that's my proposed idea about changing the anthems. I hope you find it interesting and we may discuss it.

,That's ultimately how every dodgy thing gains acceptance: an RNG BiS in a painful instance, virtues, BBs, new LI base dps, new traceries that break game mechanics/ai.  And ""metrics"" for the CM to offer up a ""seems popular"" when most prior content just got ""cancelled"". And with each ""inducement"" supplied the clawback (we see here) and the fall even further behind for those not so engaged.,
,
,
How many of us have the resources, cash or otherwise, to discover our best builds for how we play and what we do? Only way my Red mini gets a raid slot is if the healing mini becomes a pariah in groups. That's down to player perception; Mini - heal, Guard - tank end of.,

Survivability is all about movement. Stood in place like a lemon or always on the move with the skills developed over years to not pull adds.

,
All the explanations the OP has replied with could be simply implemented with tweaks to the existing Minstrel setup. What is the point of making changes if the end point will deliver what you are suggesting if you loose a lot of peeps in the process?,

					Piercing cry having a stun has been a thing ever since the game released years and years ago. To me it's a core thing for Red mini ever since, perhaps because it was one of the first red trait you used to get.,
I doubt it was that OP, considering nobody noticed how strong it was for the past, what, 14years ?,
,
It didn't clean corruption for a long time though. If that's the issue, then move the corruption cleaning to another skill ?,
,
,
For the rest, I can't say. I never played yellow mini, so I'm not overly affected. I do not like the idea though. And as many others, I'm concerned to see the removal of many yellow trees in the future. There is already very little progression and customization past a certain level, since you get so many skill point, and many skills are not interesting to begin with. Above lvl 100-120ish, you pretty much unlocked everything you cared about already. Maybe that's an issue that should be looked upon instead ?
				"
Neinda,"Sep 04 2022, ","
					Maybe someone with the knowledge could explain why SSG feels the need to break red and blue in order to make a watered down version of yellow more appealing?,
,
These changes were not asked for by the player base and I don't see how getting a small (if any) boost on landscape while decreasing heals and buffs in group content is a positive change for the class.  The mini has never been a DPS class in group content and none of these changes will make the mini a DPS class being invited to group content.  The changes just move the mini down to the bottom of the list for classes that heal, buff and DPS.  The mini will be the go to class when nothing else is available for a vacant group spot.  Nothing in these changes will make the mini a ""must have"" addition to any group content.  It will be the opposite.  The mini will be last choice in all areas not just DPS.  With the update the mini will have nothing special or unique to offer a group unless lesser DPS/heals/buffs are wanted.  ,
,
So we will run around landscape in melody and that appears to be it for the future of the mini.  Red and blue stances will not be used for much if anything.  If they just want yellow stance minis who are mediocre at anything then this update is a major success.,
,
If you want the mini to play in group content work on the outgoing heals as the new and watered down buffs don't make up for taking away healing capability in a group.  Give the mini something to keep it a viable class in group content.,
,
The best part here is that SSG didn't even feel the need to ask for input from the player base before they dropped this in the test server as they are with other classes.  Minis found out about this change after it was a done deal and our input was not needed and unwanted.,
,
Lesson learned:  Complain about something and SSG will go to silent mode and leave things as they are.  Don't complain and SSG will nerf it since it must be something people like and enjoy.

Piercing Cry had a corruption removal component with In Their Absence; Stoneheight had us move the skill for Challenge mode.,
,
Got it's stun in 2011 with Unrelenting,
Got it's Interrupt in 2015, passthrough healing MT was great for boss interrupts.,
Sharing a Story made it OP with crit ballad resets.

,They should just move the corruption removal component to Perfect Ballad and give it a 15-30s CD while upping the damage and removing the ballad buff. It's a skill that absolutely nobody uses anyway and the effect of which is totally useless, this kind of solution would be far smarter than what we had on BR. Hell they could even give it different effects based on your stance, instead of screwing with Piercing Cry to try and force Melody to be used.

,Yeah, no. The only thing that's gone completely useless is Guild crafting. And I'm hoping against hope that won't be a forever thing. Otherwise, you can have my crafted gear when you pry it out of my cold, dead hands. :P,
,
As for corruption removal, on live we also have that on Herald's Strike and Cry of the Valar. Yellow Mini is a corruption removal machine. For now. They probably did go a little overboard with it.

					,, I've come around to feeling even more strongly that I don't want you to do this.  I have always loved the Protector of Song Minstrel, like I said ever since before trait trees locked you into that.,
,
I can see the perspective that ""oh they're half-healers and half-fighters and that's pointless so just throw the buffs out there for Blue and Red to pick up"".,
,
But that's not actually what a Yellow mini is.  Yellow mini is a buffer first and foremost! The ability to heal AND damage with equal measure (but not simultaneously!) is a really fun REALLY flavorful role for a Minstrel!,
,
So then there's the argument that... well that's a Captain!  You want a Minstrel to be a worse Captain?  No!  I've always had fun with this role, through allllllll the changes over the years to our skillsets and effectiveness (oh god, the scar of the PAIN of post-Mordor awfulness of our class still lingers on my soul...),
,
Because a Minstrel's flavor and mechanics are TOTALLY different from the Captain's, even if the end result is largely similar!  The Captain is leading from the front, and micromanaging his tactics.  The Minstrel is strumming along building everyone's morale and prowess in sweeping movements and delivering a powerful crescendo!,

,Used to have interesting Corruption removal mechanics; Guard laying their 10 seconds to activate Sting on a very low CD with RK and LM backing up for resists on LT fight and everyone else removing those skills from bars. Guess it's a gank fight on level these days?,
,
But woe betide new content that's gotten any removal jeopardy in play as everyone's corruption skills are part and parcel of everyone's ""rotations"" with the trend for multi effect skills. Hardly need consider corruptions in Missions content as they are dealt with by those rotations without thought.
				"
hillard1959,"Sep 06 2022, ","
					,
,
,Pretty much. Corruptions used to matter. Of course, that was during Moria and for a little while afterwards. Now, I'm not even sure why they're still in the game. They don't actually make the content any harder or more interesting. At least not on landscape. I haven't raided in years and don't see myself going back into raids at any point in the future. Maybe if they brought difficulty scales to the live servers it might be different. But as it stands now, it's kind of a wasted system.

,I found it quite humorous the number of posts that came from people trying to solo Lamentations in Minas Morgul. You either had people asking ""how do I defeat the tree"" or others, especially hunters, asking for a quicker way to remove corruptions. Then they regulated all those things after the Bombadil server came out by adding corruptions, interrupts, and making all skills obtainable by level 20.

Anthems are an iconic part of the minstrel’s toolkit, but they aren’t always a very exciting part of the class. We want anthems to be more interesting to use, but we don’t want them to simply be a chore to maintain. To that end, anthems all now share a cooldown, have shortened durations, and can only be used in combat. We’ve also added a couple anthems and made sure they’re distributed around the trait trees. This means it won’t be possible for a single minstrel to maintain 100% uptime on all their anthems for the group. You’ll have to be a bit choosier with your anthems, but you also won’t be waiting for your anthem buffs to expire, only to pause what you’re doing and click through all of your anthems one by one to refresh the buffs.,
Anthem buffs should also now have greater parity with one another. You should always want to have more anthem buffs, without feeling like any particular anthem is an absolute must-have above everything else.,
,
Anthems also used to apply bonus effects to your next Coda, but these effects could be a bit confusing, and it could be hard to tell which ones were ‘queued up’ for your next Coda. These effects will now trigger directly off of their relevant Anthems, provided you have a point in the new ‘Invigorating Anthems’ trait.,
,
,
In 3 man groups, you may or may not have a mini so anthems may or may not be a priority. I personally run with a Hunter and a guard for most 3 mans on my 140 RK so as you see there are no mini buffs being applied in this scenario. However, when I can swap out my 140 mini for my RK, I do have a ball with her in the 3 mans. These changes are not needed in respect to anthems.  The larger groups have either a Burg, or a LM and sometimes both for buffs, debuffs, and other support duties. Minis are often asked to heal and these changes to the anthems are likely going to have more harmful affects for minis in that regard. You go into Houses of rest with a top tier group, you want that mini to know their tree inside and out. You don't want them just ""learning"" because the devs decided mid stream to make a major change. ,
Currently the mini gives a buff to tact/phys mit and some to damage as well. The third anthem gives a healing boost which is about right for the role of a healer in a group of more than 3 people. There really is no need to ""improve"" on this function.,
,
,
,
,
,
While Dissonance and Resonance have clear benefits, Melody has never had a very strong identity. While making changes to the yellow line, we wanted to strengthen the identity of the Melody stance a bit. While it can do , healing and , damage, it doesn’t excel at either, so we made some changes to make Melody better at applying debuffs, buffs, and unique effects.,
Debuffs applied by Echoes of Battle and Call of Orome are now stronger while in Melody. Similarly, Piercing Cry only removes corruptions and stuns on critical hits when used in Melody. Additionally, Call to Fate can be used in Melody, though it will do less damage than it will in Dissonance.,
,
As a 3 tree mini I see lots of things wrong with this section. First, Echos of battle changes based on your build and stance. Red and blue are the usual ones I play in landscape solo or in instances as part of a group. Yellow I will run usually only when in a small group in landscape but it does get used.  Call of Orome needs to be made ranged regardless of stance. Blue and yellow line currently they are within 5 meters. Piercing Cry needs to be left completely alone. The problem with removing the corruption removal and stun from Dissonance and Resonance stance is that there is a 5 second cool down between swapping stances. In regards to a healing mini running 3 man content, I have the job of interrupting the troll boss in Assault on Durstock. The other thing that this does is removes corruption which often times makes the boss go down a little quicker. If I had to swap from one stance to another, the heals will be lacking and could quite likely mean the difference between success and wiping on a boss. the swap requires about 1 second going each way with a 5 second cool down. So combined between lesser heals for 5 seconds and the 2 seconds of no heals at all while swapping in both directions, you have 7 seconds that stuff can go completely sideways. Sometimes that is all it takes.,
,
Minstrels have three core skills which change depending on stance: your strike, your piercing cry, and your coda. Strike skills have been rebalanced slightly against one another, so their healing and damage values change more depending on your stance. Likewise, Piercing Cry now has more utility in Melody, does more damage in Dissonance, and is weaker offensively in Resonance. Codas (when traited) also now have bonus effects related to their respective stances.,
,
Strike skills are melee range, if you are that close you are too close as a light armour caster class. Healer's job is not over just because the fight is done. So limiting the coda for in combat makes it so the ballads that get built up during the fight get wasted when the fight ends even if there is a need for that heal from the coda. Often when in 3 man if I get something that pulls off the tank, I use my Piercing cry to stun the target that comes to me and run behind the tank dragging said target when they wake up. The stun is an integral part of my healing style regardless of how often it is used or not.,
,
,
,
We know this is a lot of changes all at once, but we hope it improves overall gameplay for Minstrels, lets you access some of the unique abilities formerly hidden behind the yellow specialization, and helps you all feel like protectors of song.,
,
Keep in mind that this is Bullroarer, so some of these changes may not be final, but we want to know what you think, and we look forward to seeing your reactions and feedback below.[/QUOTE]

					""Ballads are now fast skills."",
,
Cool!,
,
""Anthems are now fast skills."",
,
Coo... wait... What? Weren't they fast before? Are they still sharing a 20-second global cd? And you've reduced anthem durations? Oh, Elbereth. ,
,
I'm waiting for BR to open so I can see for myself what was actually meant with this change. But, as it's worded now, it doesn't inspire confidence.,
,
Edit: Now that I've done that...,
,
The change to ballads was a very welcome one. Using ballads felt a lot better and there wasn't a wait to use minor ballad to tier up. Good change.,
,
Anthems still make no sense. At all. Making Anthems ""fast"" skills does absolutely nothing to address the problem. Lowering anthem duration just means you're spending more time spamming your anthems in between cries in order to keep them up. Lowering the anthem duration did not make things better. It made it worse. Not much worse, mind you. I was still pulling in a duration of over a minute per anthem, which isn't bad, but on live my anthems last for over two minutes and I can have 3 up at any given time. What we have here is a solution in search of a problem. Anthems, while easier to use than our last test session, are still in a horrible state as far as actual gameplay is concerned. Please bump anthem durations back up and, if you absolutely must have a global CD for them, please cut that in half. That might, maybe, possibly, improve things.

Kinda off-topic here but: I hope they'd change induction skills so that they just stop player movement automatically when used instead of the error popping every time when you use the skills while moving. Maybe. Anything to reduce how annoying errors can be.,

					Posting feedback in this thread is like some kind of monkey's paw situation...I haven't done any parses (yet) but here is what sticks out to me at a glance from the 2nd round of changes:,
,
- Still hate the Piercing Cry stun removal to Melody, right down to my guts.,
,
-Anthem of the Third Age Dissonance is almost certainly too strong now that it can reset Cry of the Wizards. Keep in mind this is the same effect that Call to Greatness gives us, but every 20 or so seconds instead. Its fellowship wide effect however is still significantly weaker than the blue line variant, making you a significantly worse buffer if you specialize red. Just give it -5% attack duration like Anthem of the Third Age Resonance instead of this Light/Lightning damage fluff. ,
,
- Call to Greatness still has a lot of questionable resets like Oathbreakers (the skill has a 3 minute debuff that prevents you from re-using it on a boss so this is for what...trash?) or Javelin of Deadly Force (just a useless skill). You should just change it to be a raw buff that doubles skill cd recovery rates or something, maybe give it an attack speed and movement speed buff to coincide with this. ,
,
- The red line trait bonus/passive 'Freedom' seems the most useless it has ever been, especially with the changes emphasizing Melody. It's the most obvious thing I can point to and say should be removed or updated. No one cares about it. It's an RNG proc for already weak red line heals on 1 target when you can instead just switch at any time with a .5s induction to Melody for a similar/better effect. This trait dates all the way back to when Dissonance/War Speech had a massive healing penalty and even lingered after dropping out of the stance. It's a vestige.,
,
- The other Invigorating Anthems effects are all still pretty much useless. You'd never decide to use any of the 4 other Anthems over another for their Invigorating Anthems effect, that's how you know it is useless. ,
I mean 10% lower threat reduction and 5% more tact mit for 10 whole seconds? Woah let me drop everything and make sure I hit. that. skill. lol. Our dev must be new. There's nothing wrong with that but you need to realize that threat does not exist as a consideration anymore in this game, like at all. you can ask anyone who heals...or even does DPS. Force taunts working the way they do now, absolutely no-one cares about reducing aggro at any point in any way. Either you want zero aggro or any amount of threat from non tanks -- there's nothing in between. You should also realize that you need to CONSTANTLY use your Anthems the second they are off cooldown now, so some magical timing where you care about a 5% tact mit buff that goes away a few seconds after you use it does not exist.,
,
- The Cry of the Chorus change is sort of nice as an olive branch but...the design is backwards. You want Cry of the Chorus to avoid using Ballads. you get Cry of the Chorus back...by using Ballads. ,
,
- All variants of Herald's Strike are basically useless. It has a lot of trait points associated with it too, and no one will ever use any of them. There are edge cases where you might use the skill, for a corruption clear or with the HH 4 set, but barring that no one uses it, and they certainly don't care in the slightest about the associated traits in these edge cases. ,
,
- Resonant Piercing Cry is still useless. It's a a trait trap for people who don't pay attention to their skills. There's no real 3 way variation in Piercing Cry, the skill is just a damage/interrupt except in Melody. This notion that we have 3 distinct stances with 3 distinct skills that player choice changes has nothing to do with reality. I can promise you no-one with a shred of competence has ever swapped into Melody or Dissonance or Resonance to use a particular version of Herald's strike or Piercing Cry before. ,
,
- Pause for Breath still exists, a 125% useless trait.,
,
- Every trait in the entire first row of yellow is still useless if you specialize red. That's a serious feels bad man when you need to eat a #### sandwich before you get to anything you want.,
,
- Pretty much no one is ever going to use Change of Pace because of the limits on trait points, maybe take that into consideration with the above. If it were me I'd add the Thunderous Coda default effect to the trait and make the incremental Coda ""improvements"" default (the way they are on live). Or maybe add  change of Pace's effect to the redline trait/bonus effect 'Freedom'. That would actually be cool...,
,
- The Perfect Ballad change is weird. When would you ever want to stack incoming heal on yourself?  Is this for trolling in the Moors? Especially when it comes at the expense of Outgoing healing (you can only have 3 Ballads up...either you stack incoming or outgoing healing), the whole thing seems very incoherent and only make a little bit of sense with Strike a Chord and Perfect Performance. Which I still never want to use outside of specialization in the red tree...so...yeah...Perfect Ballad still useless 90% of the time and 100% of the time while traited to heal (and the effect is FOR healing now). Consider how absurd it is to use Perfect Performance as a healer to buff your group's outgoing healing via Major Ballad, the effect is useless for almost everyone. Now consider how absurd it is to stack incoming healing only on yourself by using Perfect Ballad as the healer (without Perfect Performance), as though you're there to heal yourself and not the group or tank. Regardless of how you trait half the utility of the action is null and neither Ballad does a meaningful amount of healing or damage anyway. ,
,
-Why not do something like make Perfect Ballad an AoE heal (basically switch it with Major Ballad) and make Major Ballad a single target...that is switch with Soliloquy of Spirit. That way it can mirror the Coda effect between Resonance/Harmony while helping to shore up gaps in our rotation. It would at minimum make using Perfect Ballad less weird, it's a skill where the only use consists of taking time to do a meaningless amount of damage because you want to heal your group more...why not just heal them instead of wasting time doing no damage?,
,
-  A lot of skill values seem improved, the Thunderous Codas effect on Coda of Resonance is not one of them. It is laughably low. Here's an idea...why not have Codas give a version of your current Ballad buffs to the group. Perfect Ballad gives incoming heals, Minor gives a damage buff, Major adds a heal. This would add a tiny bit of dynamism to healing and if you make the buff last long enough in theory you'd want to stack stack the variants and thus have a good reason to use Coda at last. ,
,
,
People do not want to use Ballads while healing. If you want to make people want to use Ballads, you are going to have to do something that makes using Ballads interesting. Making it marginally less painful to use Ballads by making them Fast does not accomplish this. I fully expect that I and most Minstrels will still refuse to cash out Coda without Cry of the Chorus up in blue. This means that several traits in the blue line are useless or very nearly useless and I would VASTLY prefer the previous iteration when I could use Coda much more often without wasting time spamming Major Ballad which is a completely garbage skill. Which, btw, so is Coda, you want Ballads for the buffs and for unlocking Anthems NOT so you can use Coda, Coda of Resonance itself does very little, it's basically 1 Bolster Courage despite requiring in theory 4 skill uses, and it does even less than ever after these changes...,
,
This not only feels like a nerf, but a nerf that actually reduces the size of of our toolkit and the variety of skills used. You want to Coda to get Improved Coda of Resonance on your tank. You want to Coda to get the 5% Incoming Healing buff on your group (which you can easily keep up 100% of the time on live but you can't on BR and this is despite the fact on BR you also need to throw in like 5 extra trait points to get this effect which is default on live). A 20k heal from Coda of Resonance Thunderous Codas IF IT CRITS is not what I'd call incentive. Stop giving with one hand and taking with the other, we notice it and it makes us not like you.,
,
,
EDIT: After a little parsing:,
,
Blue line seems fine, if not more boring than ever. The lower duration on Anthems just means more maintenance on buffs but...obviously it's better than not having -10% attack duration for the group. None of the new traits or 'mechanics' matter otherwise. You're playing exactly the same way as before except now you have more Anthems to maintain and you don't Coda as often. Perfect Ballad, Thunderous Codas, Invigorating Anthems, all totally meaningless. It's not fun but it functions. ,
,
For redline Minstrel damage seems a lot higher now. I haven't really figured out the timing for the Anthem of the Third Age or CtG reset and I only just now realized I should be using PC to interrupt Anthems...but I'm easily parsing over 400k on a housing dummy in redline with only 'ok' gear. (a little bit under Crit and Mastery cap, no HH set bonuses) with only self buffs. Melody damage is about 320k in comparison, idk if the difference might be lower because the dummy has low mitigations and Orome's debuff is wasted but I'm reasonably satisfied Melody is not more damage then Dissonance. Seems kind of whacky to be hitting 800k Call to Fates and 600k Piercing Cries now and then but I'll wait and see other people's numbers before making any assumptions.,
,
Also for reasons I cannot explain my Ballads don't crit as often in Melody as in Dissonance and my attack duration feels a lot slower. Does 'Concentration' only work in Dissonance? I wish we could just see all of our character's stats to take out all the guesswork from these things.,
,
,
,
All in all I'd summarize it as boring. I mean...we now literally have like 3 skills resetting the same skills now in red (1 of which is a reset you use for more resets which reset I'm not even joking, you use Coda to reset skills including CotC which you use to reset Anthem of the Third Age which you use to reset the skills you just reset). Nothing new, everything recycled, this isn't creative or engaging gameplay and I don't enjoy it. I can already feel the carpal tunnel as I spam Piercing Cry endlessly with even more desperation than before.,
,
,
,
Extra thoughts:,
-Cry of the Chorus giving you 3 Perfect Ballad buffs feels super bad. It should give you either 3 Major or 3 Minor depending on your specialization, especially now that you want to use it to reset Anthem CDs.,
,
-Cry of the Chorus resetting Anthems feels kind of bad in itself because...haha...you use it to start off fights...when you have no Anthems up. You should instead make it so the buff causes your next Anthem doesn't incur the shared CD. ,
I mean imagine you just used Coda in Melody and it reset your Anthems....which you can't use because you don't have Ballad buffs up now since you just used Coda...and now you have to use Cry of the Chorus to get back your Ballads...and CotC resets your already reset Anthems. I'd laugh if it wasn't so sad a picture, who thought up this demented scheme?,
,
-Echoes of Battle seems to bug out constantly and not let you use it giving the error 'too far away' even if the mob is right in front of you.,
,
-Still hate Piercing Cry not stunning outside of Melody. I want the stun while both red and blue and I don't have it unless I interrupt myself TWICE by swapping into an otherwise useless stance just so I can swap out of it. Absolutely loathsome.,
,
- To illustrate how annoying Melody is I will say something I probably shouldn't....currently everyone will want to swap into Melody to get Echoes up on a boss for the Crit Defense debuff and then swap back into either our healing or DPS stance. Echoes maintains itself when you change stances. You quite literally will go into and then instantly out of Melody at the start of serious encounters pretty much every time. If this sounds completely stupid to you, that's because it is. On top of that you want to CotC before swapping, so you don't get the wrong Ballad buffs, meaning you actually swap stances 3 times back to back to back.

Carywary,"Today, ","
					I was ready to be super upset that my beloved minstrel was under the knife this round of updates, and I logged into bullroarer today and I don't understand what all the doom and gloom is about.  I will say I never really touched yellow line to begin with and probably wasn't using my anthems as effectively as some.,
,
I'm an average minstrel who's been here since closed beta in the beginning, and as a semi-casual player with many, many years of main minstrel, here are my impressions:,
,
My DPS is the same or better in red line than it is on live.  I ran some missions and went solo into a 3 man den of Pughlak just to see how it 'felt' and I did better in Bullroarer than when I subsequently tried the same thing back on live.  This is with a character I transferred today so both should otherwise be the same utility.,
,
Heals felt like they were a little less, I spent some time with a bunch of trash mobs in a mission and just focused on healing myself, and I didn't die, but my output seemed less in blue line than I'm used to.  It wasn't a great test because I wasn't healing a group.  ,
,
Overall for myself I don't see this change being as big a deal as some are making it out to be.  if you are a dedicated yellow line buffer set... I'm sorry.  Otherwise, I think we'll be ok ,
				"
hillard1959,"Today, ","
					,
,
,Well, DPS is better. By a wide margin, I think. ,
,
I don't know about group heals, as that's not really my thing anymore, BUT... Skills like Bolster My Courage seem to be healing more in Dissonance than they do on live. Not a whole lot more, mind you, but every little bit counts. But others here who do run Blue line have noticed a drop off in healing output, so I think this is something that should be addressed.,
,
Are we going to be fine? Sure. This is still a far cry from the broken state we arrived in on launch day of Moria. But it could be improved. PC stun being removed from Dissonance is going to be deeply felt, given that it's been a core part of red line for more than a decade now. I've yet to see anybody that's actually happy about that. And anthems still need to be iterated on, as they really aren't in the best place as it stands now. To me and you, it may not seem like that big a deal. Mainly because for the content we're playing on, landscape and, I suspect, T1 dungeons and the like, it's not really a deal breaker. But for those who play the higher tiered dungeons and raids, they're going to feel the difference much more keenly. In light of that, it really does need to be addressed.
				"
infinitewhimsy,"Today, ","
					,
,
,If anything I imagine landscape is the most affected, the PC stun and feign death nerfs, etc... I expect end game Minstrels to be happy, outside of 3 minutes via pre-buffing and swapping trees we didn't have access to a lot of things we now have access to. It just feels clunky, but I'm sure the numbers are there.
				"
hillard1959,"Today, ","
					,
,
,Well, the increased damage will be very nice. PC stun is going to be awful to be without. Feign Death isn't really a factor in most landscape encounters except when you just want to aggro train instead of fighting every mob on your way to wherever it is you're running to. Even then, 10 seconds is more than enough time for whatever is chasing you to drop off and run back to wherever you dragged them from. My biggest drum to beat here are anthems. I'm in the habit of keeping my buffs up as much as I can, especially when running solo dungeons. As it stands, I just don't like the Anthem changes. This current round did not make anthems better in that regard. I shouldn't be worried about spamming anthems every few seconds when I'm, say, fighting the frog boss (or any of the bosses, really) in Den of Pughlak. I want the buffs, but I also have better things to do. It also gets my goat that if prebuffing was what they wanted to get rid of, changing anthems to only be usable in combat would have been enough. Nothing else about that needed to change at all. Instead, we've been stripped of another spec for a utility tree of dubious usefulness with changes that make no sense. The increased damage I wanted. (But never asked for 'cause I can still solo and that was the point of War Speech in the first place.) Faster ballads are a very nice change. Everything else is just change for change's sake.
